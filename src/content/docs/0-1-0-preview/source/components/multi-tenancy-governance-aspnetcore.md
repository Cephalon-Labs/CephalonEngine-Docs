`Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.AspNetCore` is the optional ASP.NET Core host adapter for tenant-domain ownership HTTP proof publication, tenant-administration workflow commands, tenant-invitation delivery dispatch requests, normalized tenant-invitation delivery status callbacks, and bounded reads plus filtered rollup summaries, attention-category drill-downs, remediation-action filters, provider-message drill-downs, and remediation hints over normalized delivery-status observation history.

## What it owns

- opt-in ASP.NET Core routing for published tenant-domain ownership HTTP file proofs
- default `/.well-known/cephalon/{**proofPath}` proof-file endpoint mapping
- opt-in ASP.NET Core routing for tenant-administration workflow commands over the host-agnostic governance workflow
- default `POST /engine/tenant-administration/commands` command endpoint mapping
- fail-closed tenant-administration authorization by default, with an optional ASP.NET Core policy override
- opt-in ASP.NET Core routing for tenant-invitation delivery dispatch requests over the host-agnostic invitation delivery dispatcher
- default `POST /engine/tenant-invitations/delivery-dispatches` dispatch endpoint mapping
- fail-closed delivery-dispatch authorization by default, with an optional ASP.NET Core policy override
- opt-in ASP.NET Core routing for normalized tenant-invitation delivery status callbacks over the host-agnostic invitation delivery status reconciler
- default `POST /engine/tenant-invitations/delivery-status` callback endpoint mapping
- fail-closed delivery-status callback authorization by default, with an optional ASP.NET Core policy override
- provider-message-match enforcement for callback requests by default so the adapter cannot attach a status observation to the wrong invitation silently
- opt-in provider-neutral HMAC-SHA256 callback signature verification over the exact normalized JSON request body
- bounded process-local replay protection for signed normalized delivery-status callbacks
- opt-in ASP.NET Core routing for bounded delivery-status observation reads over the host-agnostic observation store
- default `GET /engine/tenant-invitations/delivery-status/observations` observation read endpoint mapping
- fail-closed delivery-status observation authorization by default, with an optional ASP.NET Core policy override
- bounded and filterable observation reads by tenant id, invitation id, status, outcome, source, provider message id, correlation id, attention category, remediation action, reconciled, recorded, and limit
- filtered observation rollup summaries by status, attention, remediation action, outcome, source, provider message id, channel, sender, and tenant before the response record limit is applied
- stable observation attention categories for delivery failures, deferred delivery, suppressed delivery, unknown delivery status, reconciliation gaps, and recording gaps
- deterministic observation remediation hints for matched attention categories, including action labels, counts, latest timestamps, and drill-down filters
- stable remediation-action filtering so operators can drill into records by the safe next-action label they intend to review
- stable provider-message filtering so operators can trace provider callbacks or provider delivery ids back to normalized observation records
- adapter runtime truth through the `tenant-administration-http-endpoints` technology surface
- adapter runtime truth through the `tenant-invitation-delivery-http-endpoints` technology surface
- adapter runtime truth through the `tenant-invitation-delivery-status-http-endpoints` technology surface
- host configuration for enabling/disabling endpoints, route patterns, cache-control header, authorization posture, endpoint-description visibility, callback signature headers, callback signing key id, timestamp tolerance, signed-callback replay retention, signed-callback replay cache limits, observation read default limit, and observation read max limit
- serving only proof files that the host-agnostic governance catalog reports as published for the current request host and path
- keeping the HTTP serving layer outside `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance` so the governance core remains host-agnostic

## How it fits

The core `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance` package owns HTTP proof publication state through `ITenantDomainOwnershipHttpProofPublisher` and `ITenantDomainOwnershipHttpProofPublicationCatalog`, host-driven tenant-administration workflow commands through `ITenantAdministrationWorkflow`, delivery status reconciliation through `ITenantInvitationDeliveryStatusReconciler`, and normalized delivery-status observation storage through `ITenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservationStore`. It intentionally does not reference ASP.NET Core. This adapter is the thin host layer that turns those host-agnostic states into real HTTP responses, normalized HTTP ingress, bounded operator reads, filtered observation rollup summaries, attention-category drill-downs, remediation-action filters, provider-message drill-downs, and deterministic remediation hints for ASP.NET Core apps.

Register the adapter options beside the normal governance package, then explicitly map the endpoints the host wants:

```csharp
builder.AddCephalonMultiTenancyGovernanceAspNetCore();

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapCephalonTenantDomainOwnershipHttpProofs();
app.MapCephalonTenantAdministrationCommands();
app.MapCephalonTenantInvitationDeliveryDispatches();
app.MapCephalonTenantInvitationDeliveryStatusCallbacks();
app.MapCephalonTenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservations();
```

By default, published proof files are served from `/.well-known/cephalon/{**proofPath}` with `Cache-Control: no-store` and are excluded from OpenAPI/endpoint descriptions. Hosts can override those defaults through `Engine:MultiTenancy:Governance:AspNetCore`.

By default, tenant-administration commands are mapped at `POST /engine/tenant-administration/commands`, are excluded from endpoint descriptions, and require authorization. The handler also performs a fail-closed authorization check so a host that accidentally omits authorization middleware does not execute membership or invitation mutations anonymously. Hosts can deliberately disable the command endpoint, change the route, disable the authorization requirement for an internal/test host, or require a named ASP.NET Core policy with `TenantAdministrationAuthorizationPolicy`.

By default, tenant-invitation delivery dispatch requests are mapped at `POST /engine/tenant-invitations/delivery-dispatches`, are excluded from endpoint descriptions, and require authorization. The handler performs the same fail-closed authorization check before it calls `ITenantInvitationDeliveryDispatcher`, adds safe adapter metadata such as `aspNetCoreInvitationDeliveryDispatch`, the mapped route, and dispatch endpoint ownership, and defaults the dispatch source to `aspnetcore-invitation-delivery-dispatch` when the request does not supply one. Hosts can deliberately disable the dispatch endpoint, change the route, disable the authorization requirement for an internal/test host, or require a named ASP.NET Core policy with `TenantInvitationDeliveryDispatchAuthorizationPolicy`. The endpoint exposes the engine-owned dispatch action only; registered sender behavior and external provider delivery stay with the configured sender package, opt-in background retry scheduling stays with the core governance retry store/runner, and distributed retry queues plus provider-specific sender semantics stay with later provider/application code until a package owns them.

By default, delivery-status callbacks are mapped at `POST /engine/tenant-invitations/delivery-status`, are excluded from endpoint descriptions, require authorization, and enforce provider-message matching even if the callback body attempts to disable that safety check. The request body is `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusCallbackRequest`, a provider-neutral normalized shape with tenant id, invitation id, status, provider message id, sender id, channel, reason, observed timestamp, source, actor, correlation id, and safe metadata. Provider-specific webhook bodies should be translated into that shape by the host or a provider companion before reaching this generic endpoint; first-party SendGrid Event Webhook translation lives in `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.SendGridDelivery.AspNetCore`, and first-party Mailgun webhook translation lives in `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.MailgunDelivery.AspNetCore`.

When `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusCallbackSigningSecret` is configured, the endpoint also requires a provider-neutral Cephalon callback signature before it parses or reconciles the request. The signature header defaults to `X-Cephalon-Callback-Signature`, the timestamp header defaults to `X-Cephalon-Callback-Signature-Timestamp`, the optional key-id header defaults to `X-Cephalon-Callback-Key-Id`, and the signature value uses `v1=<hex-hmac-sha256>` over `{unixTimestamp}.{exactUtf8JsonBody}`. The default timestamp tolerance is five minutes and can be changed with `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusCallbackSignatureToleranceSeconds`. Signature failures return `401` and do not call the reconciler or mutate invitation state.

When signed callback replay protection is enabled, which is the default, the endpoint records a bounded in-memory fingerprint of each accepted signed callback and rejects the same signed request with `409` inside `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusCallbackReplayRetentionSeconds`. The replay key is a SHA-256 fingerprint of the verified signature header value, never the raw signature or signing secret. `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusCallbackReplayCacheLimit` bounds the process-local cache and evicts the oldest accepted fingerprint when the cache is full. This is intentionally process-local and non-durable: it reduces duplicate signed callback processing inside one host process, but it does not claim distributed replay protection, provider-specific callback inbox ownership, or cross-node exactly-once delivery. Accepted normalized callbacks still flow into the core reconciler's observation store, which can retain normalized audit records in memory or an opt-in local JSON file.

By default, delivery-status observations are read from `GET /engine/tenant-invitations/delivery-status/observations`, are excluded from endpoint descriptions, require authorization, and return `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservationQueryResult`. The response includes observation-store kind, durability, ownership, total/matched/returned counts, effective limit, normalized filters, `SummaryCount`, filtered `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservationSummaryDescriptor` rollups, `RemediationHintCount`, `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservationRemediationHintDescriptor` guidance, and the bounded `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservationDescriptor` records ordered by newest recorded observation first. The summaries and remediation hints are derived from the matched normalized observation set before `limit` truncates the returned records, so a small page can still carry operator posture by status, attention, remediation action, outcome, source, provider message id, channel, sender, and tenant plus safe next-action guidance. Hosts can filter by `tenantId`, `invitationId`, `status`, `outcome`, `source`, `providerMessageId`, `correlationId`, `attention`, `remediation`, `reconciled`, and `recorded`, and can pass `limit`; `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservationMaxLimit` clamps the response so one operator read cannot dump unbounded history. The stable attention categories are `delivery-failed`, `delivery-deferred`, `delivery-suppressed`, `delivery-unknown`, `reconciliation-gap`, and `recording-gap`; the stable remediation actions are `review-recipient-or-sender`, `monitor-deferred-delivery`, `review-suppression-policy`, `review-status-translation`, `review-reconciliation-input`, and `review-observation-recording`. They let operators drill into observations that need review by attention category, remediation action, or provider message id and understand the next safe human or host workflow step without claiming provider polling, callback inbox ownership, distributed remediation execution, distributed replay, or exactly-once delivery.

The adapter reports its command endpoint posture through the `tenant-administration-http-endpoints` runtime surface, its dispatch endpoint posture through `tenant-invitation-delivery-http-endpoints`, and its callback plus observation read endpoint posture through `tenant-invitation-delivery-status-http-endpoints`. A mapped endpoint reports `cephalon-managed`; an enabled but unmapped endpoint reports `host-mapping-required`; a disabled endpoint reports `not-configured`. The delivery-dispatch surface reports route, `POST` method, authorization posture, endpoint-description posture, `TenantInvitationDeliveryRequest`/`TenantInvitationDeliveryResult` contracts, and explicit `application-managed` boundaries for provider-specific senders, distributed retry queues, public onboarding, tenant-admin UI, identity-provider sync, and provider polling while the core governance `tenant-invitations` surface reports opt-in background retry scheduling posture. The delivery-status surface reports callback route, method, authorization posture, endpoint-description posture, provider-message-match enforcement, provider-neutral callback signature verification posture, signed-callback replay posture, observation read route, `GET` method, authorization posture, response contract, bounded default/max limits, observation summary ownership, observation summary scope, summary dimensions, observation attention ownership, attention scope, supported attention categories, observation provider-message filter ownership, provider-message filter scope, observation remediation-filter ownership, remediation-filter scope, observation remediation-hint ownership, remediation-hint scope, supported remediation actions, and explicit `application-managed` boundaries for provider-specific callback inboxes, non-SendGrid provider payload translation, provider-specific signature verification, provider polling, and distributed remediation execution.

The callback surface also reports whether provider-neutral callback signature verification is configured, which safe header names are expected, whether a signing key id is configured, the effective timestamp tolerance, whether signed replay protection is active, the replay policy, replay key shape, process-local scope, non-durable posture, retention seconds, and cache limit. It never exposes the configured signing secret or received signature value; reconciled observations may store only a safe `sha256:` replay fingerprint for correlation. SendGrid Event Webhook payload translation is a separate optional provider-pack responsibility in `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.SendGridDelivery.AspNetCore`; Mailgun webhook payload translation is a separate optional provider-pack responsibility in `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.MailgunDelivery.AspNetCore`; provider-specific signature verification beyond the normalized callback endpoint remains a separate application/provider-pack responsibility.

This package does not issue challenges, plan proof instructions, mutate DNS records, call domain providers, verify collected evidence, run background polling, implement provider-specific invitation senders, translate provider callback payloads itself, verify provider-specific callback signatures, poll delivery providers, create identity-provider users, execute distributed remediation, run background/distributed delivery queues, or provide a backoffice UI. Those responsibilities stay in `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance`, provider-specific packs such as `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.SendGridDelivery.AspNetCore` and `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.MailgunDelivery.AspNetCore`, future provider-specific packs, or consumer applications. The adapter only serves the HTTP file content that the host-agnostic publication catalog has already accepted as published, exposes the workflow command endpoint that the host explicitly maps, exposes a delivery-dispatch action endpoint over the dispatcher the governance core already owns, accepts normalized status callback requests for the reconciler the governance core already owns, optionally verifies the normalized callback body's Cephalon HMAC signature, rejects process-local signed replays before reconciliation, and exposes a bounded read endpoint plus filtered rollup summaries, attention-category filtering, remediation-action filtering, provider-message filtering, and deterministic remediation hints over normalized observation history that the governance core already recorded.
