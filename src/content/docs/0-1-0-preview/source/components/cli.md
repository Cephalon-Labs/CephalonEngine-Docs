`Cephalon.Cli` is the user-facing command-line surface for Cephalon scaffolding, external package staging, first-run environment verification, and documentation workflows.

See also: [Engine surface maturity audit](../engine-surface-maturity-audit.md), [Conformance matrix](../conformance-matrix.md), and [Runtime contract index](../runtime-contract-index.md) for what the CLI's `cephalon doctor` and `cephalon new` ultimately project against. [Engineering standards](../engineering-standards.md) records the library-design and code-quality baseline; [Long-range engine direction](../long-range-direction.md) frames why the CLI stays a thin scaffolding/verification surface over the engine's host-agnostic catalogs rather than owning runtime truth itself.

Stable public surface:

- `CliApplication`

Internal command pipeline:

- `Commands/*`
- `Console/CliConsole.cs`
- `Commands/DocumentationLauncher.cs`

## What it owns

## How it fits

This package is the shell over engine, scaffolding, and optional reference-doc services. It should stay aligned with engine semantics rather than inventing its own blueprint or documentation behavior. The `cephalon new` path now emits the same operator-ready local orchestration assets and broader container assets, Windows Service deployment assets, IIS deployment assets, Azure App Service deployment assets, provider-neutral container-image publishing assets, Azure Container Apps deployment assets, Kubernetes deployment assets, Linux `systemd` deployment assets, generated guidance docs (`README.md`, `./.cephalon/packages/README.md`, `Configurations/README.md`, and deployment guides such as `deploy/windows-service/README.md`), `NuGet.config` bootstrap, `Program.cs` host bootstrap source, host-project `PackageReference` baseline plus `Configurations/**/*.json` copy/publish behavior, and `Properties/PublishProfiles/CephalonFolder.pubxml` profile used by the shipped app-starter baseline so generated hosts can restore from `./.cephalon/packages`, or a swapped-in shared feed, before they are validated with `dotnet publish`, Windows Service install previews, IIS install previews, Azure App Service ZIP deploy previews, container-image publish previews, Azure Container Apps source-deploy previews, Kubernetes manifest previews, WSL `systemd-analyze` verification, published-output smoke runs, or `docker compose up --build`.
That same adoption path now stays truthful through `cephalon doctor --app-root <path>`, which layers generated-app bootstrap checks for the solution, package baseline, package-source reachability, generated host project, generated `Program.cs` bootstrap source with explicit `AddCephalonProjectConfigurations` and `MapCephalon` flow, host-project `PackageReference` plus `Configurations/**/*.json` copy/publish baseline alignment, generated test-project discovery, generated `Architecture/CompositionSmokeTests.cs` plus `Features/*BehaviorSpecifications.cs` Given/When/Then test harness placeholder alignment, `CephalonFolder.pubxml`, generated host target framework, generated split-config assets (`Configurations/AddEngine.*.json` plus `Configurations/Observability/Development.json`), generated app-model plus engine-feature plus observability plus localization plus development-Serilog baseline alignment, generated guidance docs (`README.md`, `./.cephalon/packages/README.md`, `Configurations/README.md`, and deployment guides such as `deploy/windows-service/README.md`), generated documentation-surface assets (`Configurations/AddOpenApi.json` and `Configurations/AddReferenceDocs.json`), generated self-hosted and hosted deployment assets plus teardown and environment baselines (`deploy/windows-service/remove-service.ps1`, `deploy/iis/remove-site.ps1`, and `deploy/linux/systemd/<App>.env`), generated container deployment assets, generated container deployment scripts (`deploy/container-image/publish-image.ps1`, `deploy/azure-container-apps/deploy-up.ps1`, and `deploy/kubernetes/apply.ps1`), generated Kubernetes manifest baselines (`deploy/kubernetes/kustomization.yaml`, `deploy/kubernetes/namespace.yaml`, `deploy/kubernetes/deployment.yaml`, and `deploy/kubernetes/service.yaml`), generated local orchestration assets, generated Dockerfile base-image alignment, generated compose plus collector baseline alignment, and generated publish-mode claims on top of the machine-level SDK/runtime/template checks.
`cephalon doctor` now also surfaces the packaged deployment-mode support contract directly from the CLI so adopters see the stable shipping floor (`net10.0`), the `.NET 11` readiness lane (`assessment-only`), and the current trim / Native AOT / single-file `not-claimed` posture from the same command path instead of rediscovering those limits only in repo docs, while `cephalon doctor --app-root` compares the generated host's target framework, generated Dockerfile baseline, and `PublishTrimmed`, `PublishAot`, and `PublishSingleFile` settings against that same contract.
The same CLI path now owns the phase-8 starter contract too: canonical kebab-case `Engine` ids, structured `Engine:Data`, `Engine:Identity`, `Engine:Tenancy`, `Engine:Audit`, and `Engine:Messaging` sections, a low-ceremony `Sfid` plus `Audit` default, and starter test harness placeholders that steer teams toward composition smoke checks plus Given/When/Then-style business specifications instead of hand-written plumbing. The repo also now carries `scripts/validate-generated-app-adoption.ps1` as the scenario-driven external cold-start replay for that CLI-owned path: publish a temporary package feed, install the tool, run `cephalon doctor`, scaffold a fresh app outside the repository, seed `./.cephalon/packages` without losing the generated README guidance, rerun `cephalon doctor --app-root`, restore, build, run, and probe the generated host from one script. The matching `dotnet new` parity path now lives in `scripts/validate-template-pack-adoption.ps1`, which installs `Cephalon.TemplatePack` into an isolated custom hive, lets `cephalon doctor` see that hive through `CEPHALON_DOCTOR_TEMPLATE_HIVE`, scaffolds a project-root starter, and proves that `cephalon doctor --app-root` stays truthful for template-pack output too. The out-of-tree package parity follow-through now lives in `scripts/validate-out-of-tree-package-adoption.ps1`, which packs and stages `Cephalon.ReferenceModule.Operations` through `cephalon package stage`, patches `Engine:Discovery:PackageDirectories` plus `Engine:PackagePolicy` and `Engine:Trust`, and proves that the same CLI-owned path keeps staged-package truth visible on `/engine/packages`, `/engine/package-policy`, `/engine/trust-policy`, `/engine/snapshot`, and `/api/operations/status`. The higher-assurance signed-governance follow-through now lives in `scripts/validate-signed-package-governance.ps1`, which repacks that same reference module with a deterministic detached signature, stages the signed `.nupkg`, patches stricter `Engine:PackagePolicy` plus `Engine:Trust:TrustedSignaturePublicKeys`, and proves from the same CLI-owned path that verified signer truth appears on `/engine/packages`, `/engine/trust-policy`, and `/engine/snapshot` while a tampered signed package is denied when signature verification is required. The matching certificate-chain follow-through now lives in `scripts/validate-signed-package-certificate-chain-governance.ps1`, which replays the same lane with `Engine:Trust:TrustedSignatureCertificates` plus `Engine:Trust:TrustedSignatureCertificateAuthorities` and proves that the same operator surfaces expose `trusted-certificate-chain` plus the signing `certificateThumbprint`.

For package-surface hardening, the command handlers, parsed option objects, console abstraction, and browser launcher are implementation details. External callers should integrate through `CliApplication` rather than binding directly to individual command types.
