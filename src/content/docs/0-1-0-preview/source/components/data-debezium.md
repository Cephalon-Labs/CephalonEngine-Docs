`Cephalon.Data.Debezium` is the Debezium-managed external CDC companion pack for Cephalon. It proves that the shared `Cephalon.Data` CDC runtime story also fits managed Kafka Connect or Debezium-style connector topologies where Cephalon does not own the runner, does not fake a hosted execution, and still publishes truthful capture ownership, external runtime reporting, reporter-lease posture, connector or task lifecycle posture, managed-connector governance posture, desired-versus-observed managed-connector drift posture, managed-connector action-planning posture, managed-connector write-path readiness posture, managed-connector preflight posture, managed-connector dry-run posture, managed-connector execution-intent posture, managed-connector execution-approval posture, managed-connector command-envelope posture, managed-connector command-issuance posture, managed-connector execution-adapter posture, managed-connector command-execution outcome/history, managed-connector command-retry posture, managed-connector retry-execution-policy posture, managed-connector bounded command-journal posture, and operator drill-downs on the existing shared `/engine/cdc-*`, `/engine/runtime-story`, and `snapshot` surfaces.

## What it owns

- contributes Debezium-managed capture descriptors through `DebeziumCaptureOptions` and keeps those descriptors on the shared `/engine/cdc-captures*` catalog with `provider = "debezium"` and `mode = "managed-connector"`
- contributes external execution runtimes through `DebeziumConnectorOptions` and keeps those runtimes on the shared `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes*` catalog with `executionOwnership = external-managed`, `executionTopology = managed-connector`, and `acknowledgementMode = connector-offset-commit`
- wires the shared external-reporting sink automatically when Debezium connectors are configured, so hosts that already add `Cephalon.Data` do not also need to remember `EnableExternalCdcRuntimeReporting = true` just to accept managed connector reports
- normalizes connector, task, reconciliation, managed-connector governance, and desired-versus-observed drift metadata from external Debezium reports into stable `debezium*` plus shared `managedConnector*` metadata on the existing capture and execution-runtime surfaces so the shared `Cephalon.Data` catalog can also derive operator-facing action plans without inventing a Debezium-only lifecycle, governance, drift, or action registry
- preserves authored capture ownership through `CdcCaptureDescriptor.SourceModuleId` while surfacing `metadata.contributorModuleId = "debezium-data"` when the Debezium pack contributes descriptors on behalf of another module

## Main surfaces

- `Configuration/DebeziumDataOptions.cs`
- `Configuration/DebeziumConnectorOptions.cs`
- `Configuration/DebeziumCaptureOptions.cs`
- `Modules/DebeziumDataModule.cs`
- `Registration/DebeziumDataEngineBuilderExtensions.cs`
- `Services/DebeziumExecutionRuntimeContributor.cs`
- `Services/DebeziumExecutionRuntimeReportSink.cs`

## How it fits

This pack sits on top of `Cephalon.Data`, not in place of it. `Cephalon.Data` still owns the shared CDC descriptor catalog, capture-side execution binding, runtime-state catalog, execution-runtime catalog, operator drill-down routes, runtime story, and snapshot surfaces. `Cephalon.Data.Debezium` adds the managed-connector contribution layer that declares Debezium-owned captures and external execution runtimes on those shared surfaces without inventing a Debezium-specific registry.

That keeps the runtime honest. `Cephalon.Data.Debezium` does not pretend Cephalon runs Kafka Connect tasks or connector worker loops itself, so it does not contribute a fake execution graph or hosted execution. The actual managed connector stays out of process and reports observations back into the shared runtime story through `POST /engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/{executionRuntimeId}/reports`, while this pack normalizes connector or task lifecycle, reconciliation detail, and managed-connector governance or drift inputs into additive shared metadata so the engine-owned catalog can answer the operator action plan without inventing a second Debezium operator catalog.

The slice also stays intentionally scoped. This pack does not claim Kafka Connect provisioning, Debezium REST management, connector lifecycle orchestration, schema-registry management, or provider-native read/write persistence. It exists to project truthful Debezium-managed capture and runtime topology onto the shared Cephalon CDC surfaces, with non-`observe-only` management declarations remaining governance truth about future intent rather than a shipped write-path controller.

## Registration

```csharp
engine.AddData();

engine.AddDebeziumData(options =>
{
    var connector = new DebeziumConnectorOptions
    {
        Id = "inventory-debezium-connector",
        DisplayName = "Inventory Debezium Connector",
        Description = "Represents a Debezium-managed PostgreSQL connector.",
        ConnectClusterId = "connect-cluster-a",
        ConnectorClass = "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
        SourceProviderId = "postgresql",
        TopicPrefix = "inventory",
        ManagementMode = "observe-only",
        ObservationStaleAfterSeconds = 180,
        ReporterLeaseSeconds = 120,
        RejectConflictingReporterIds = true,
        ExpectedTaskCount = 2
    };
    connector.EdgeNodeIds.Add("edge-bkk-01");
    connector.TaskIds.Add("0");
    connector.TaskIds.Add("1");
    connector.CdcCaptures.Add(new DebeziumCaptureOptions
    {
        Id = "inventory-customers-cdc",
        DisplayName = "Inventory Customers CDC",
        SourceModuleId = "inventory",
        OutboxId = "tenant-event-outbox",
        TopicName = "inventory.public.customers",
        SnapshotMode = "initial"
    });

    options.Connectors.Add(connector);
});
```

For configuration-driven hosts, prefer binding from `Engine:Data:Debezium`:

```json
{
  "Engine": {
    "Data": {
      "Debezium": {
        "Connectors": [
          {
            "Id": "inventory-debezium-connector",
            "DisplayName": "Inventory Debezium Connector",
            "ConnectClusterId": "connect-cluster-a",
            "ConnectorClass": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
            "SourceProviderId": "postgresql",
            "TopicPrefix": "inventory",
            "ManagementMode": "observe-only",
            "ObservationStaleAfterSeconds": 180,
            "ReporterLeaseSeconds": 120,
            "RejectConflictingReporterIds": true,
            "ExpectedTaskCount": 2,
            "EdgeNodeIds": ["edge-bkk-01"],
            "TaskIds": ["0", "1"],
            "CdcCaptures": [
              {
                "Id": "inventory-customers-cdc",
                "DisplayName": "Inventory Customers CDC",

                "SnapshotMode": "initial"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`engine.AddData()` is still required because the shared `Cephalon.Data` pack owns the runtime-state catalog, execution-runtime catalog, and shared `/engine/cdc-*` surfaces. `Cephalon.Data.Debezium` removes the extra host ceremony for enabling external runtime reports once that shared data pack is present.

## Managed connector runtime behavior

When Debezium connectors are configured:

- each connector publishes one external execution runtime through `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes*` and `snapshot.CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimes`
- each contributed capture binds to that runtime through authored and requested `executionRuntimeId` so the shared runtime catalog resolves external ownership deterministically
- the shared `POST /engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/{executionRuntimeId}/reports` route becomes available without requiring `EnableExternalCdcRuntimeReporting = true` explicitly on `DataRuntimeOptions`
- later runtime reports can still surface reporter id, edge node id, stale observation posture, reporter-lease expiry, degraded coordination posture, connector or task lifecycle metadata, and operator drill-downs through the same `/engine/cdc-captures/runtime*`, `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes*`, `/engine/runtime-story`, and `snapshot` surfaces already used by the rest of the shared CDC model

## Lifecycle and reconciliation hardening

The `ENG-165` follow-through keeps lifecycle truth additive over the shared report route instead of adding a Debezium-only status registry.

- connector declarations can now publish `ManagementMode`, `ExpectedTaskCount`, and declared `TaskIds` as stable runtime expectations on both capture and execution-runtime metadata
- runtime reports can now include raw Debezium-facing keys such as `connectorState`, `reportedTaskIds`, `activeTaskIds`, `failedTaskIds`, `pausedTaskIds`, `restartingTaskIds`, `taskStateSummary`, `rebalanceState`, `connectorGeneration`, and `workerId`
- the Debezium report sink now normalizes those raw values into stable `debeziumConnectorLifecycleState`, `debeziumTaskReconciliationState`, `debeziumReconciliationState`, `debeziumReconciliationReason`, and additive task-summary metadata on the shared capture runtime-state catalog
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now also promotes runtime-scoped Debezium reconciliation metadata back onto `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes*` and `snapshot.CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimes`, so operators do not need to re-open one capture payload just to understand the connector's latest reported lifecycle posture
- that same shared execution-runtime catalog now also derives `ReporterCoordinationRollup` on `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeSummary`, so Debezium-managed runtimes can answer active versus standby versus rejected reporter posture, degraded-capture ids, and coordination-state or degraded-reason breakdowns directly through `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes*` and `snapshot.CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimes` without a second Debezium rollup surface

## Managed-connector governance baseline

The `ENG-169` follow-through keeps managed-connector governance additive over the same shared
runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only control-plane catalog.

- connector declarations and runtime reports now normalize shared `managedConnector*` metadata beside the existing `debezium*` metadata, including management mode, declared versus reported task ids, expected versus reported task counts, and connector reconciliation context
- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorGovernance` now publishes stable `observe-only`, `future-control-plane`, and `out-of-policy` posture for Debezium-managed runtimes together with governance categories, recommended action ids, and the latest lifecycle or reconciliation context
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that governance answer from merged runtime metadata, so missing `ManagementMode`, `ConnectClusterId`, `ConnectorClass`, or `SourceProviderId` becomes truthful `out-of-policy` posture on the existing `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes*` and `snapshot.CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimes` surfaces
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/governance/{governanceState}` plus `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/governance/categories/{governanceCategory}` on the same shared runtime route family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog instead of a Debezium-only endpoint family
- non-`observe-only` values such as `apply-and-reconcile` currently surface as `future-control-plane` governance truth only; they do not mean Cephalon already owns Kafka Connect write paths

## Managed-connector drift baseline

The `ENG-170` follow-through keeps desired-versus-observed managed-connector drift additive over
that same shared runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only drift registry.

- connector declarations and runtime reports now normalize shared declared-versus-reported
  `managedConnector*` identity metadata beside the existing `debezium*` metadata, including
  connector cluster, connector class, source provider, expected task count, declared task ids, and
  reported task topology
- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorDrift` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `unknown`, `in-sync`, and `drifted` posture for Debezium-managed runtimes
  together with drift categories, recommended action ids, declared-versus-reported connector
  identity, declared-versus-reported task ids, and the latest lifecycle or reconciliation context
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that drift answer from merged runtime metadata,
  so missing task baselines, missing reported task topology, task-count mismatches, missing
  declared task ids, unexpected reported task ids, and connector-identity mismatches become
  truthful operator posture on the existing `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes*` and
  `snapshot.CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimes` surfaces
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/drift/{driftState}` plus
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/drift/categories/{driftCategory}` on the same shared runtime route
  family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog instead of a
  Debezium-only endpoint family
- drift posture currently remains read-only operator truth; it does not mean Cephalon already owns
  Kafka Connect write paths or automatic connector mutation

## Managed-connector action-planning baseline

The `ENG-171` follow-through keeps managed-connector action planning additive over that same shared
runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only operator planner.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorActionPlan` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `observe`, `waiting`, `action-required`, and `blocked` posture for
  Debezium-managed runtimes together with ordered action ids, action-plan categories, and the
  source remediation, governance, plus drift state
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that action plan from the already-shipped
  remediation, governance, and drift truth, so stale observations, governance gaps, incomplete
  task baselines, missing runtime truth, observed drift, and future control-plane declarations can
  collapse into one operator-facing answer on the existing `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes*` and
  `snapshot.CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimes` surfaces
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/action-plans/{actionPlanState}` plus
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/actions/{actionId}` on the same shared runtime route family, so
  operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog instead of a Debezium-only
  endpoint family
- action planning currently remains read-only operator truth; it does not mean Cephalon already
  owns Kafka Connect write paths, automatic connector mutation, or managed-connector control-plane
  orchestration

## Managed-connector write-path readiness baseline

The `ENG-172` follow-through keeps managed-connector write-path readiness additive over that same
shared runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only readiness planner.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorWritePathReadiness` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `deferred`, `not-ready`, `ready`, and `blocked` posture for
  Debezium-managed runtimes together with readiness categories, source
  coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan state, and the current primary action id
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that readiness answer from the already-shipped
  coverage, remediation, governance, drift, and action-planning truth, so observe-only,
  out-of-policy, incomplete-reporting, drifted, blocked, and future-control-plane declarations can
  collapse into one operator-facing answer on the existing `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes*` and
  `snapshot.CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimes` surfaces
- ASP.NET Core now maps
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/write-path-readiness/{readinessState}` plus
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/write-path-readiness/categories/{readinessCategory}` on the same
  shared runtime route family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog
  instead of a Debezium-only endpoint family
- write-path readiness currently remains read-only operator truth; it does not mean Cephalon
  already owns Kafka Connect write-path execution, automatic connector mutation, or
  managed-connector control-plane orchestration

## Managed-connector preflight baseline

The `ENG-173` follow-through keeps managed-connector preflight additive over that same shared
runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only preflight planner.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorPreflight` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `deferred`, `not-ready`, `ready`, and `blocked` posture for
  Debezium-managed runtimes together with preflight categories, the intended operation id, source
  coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan/write-path-readiness state, and the current
  primary action id
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that preflight answer from the already-shipped
  coverage, remediation, governance, drift, action-planning, and write-path-readiness truth, so
  observe-only, out-of-policy, incomplete-reporting, drifted, blocked, and future-control-plane
  declarations can surface one consistent connector-management preflight answer without claiming
  Kafka Connect write paths or automatic connector mutation
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/preflight/{preflightState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/preflight/categories/{preflightCategory}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/preflight/operations/{operationId}` on the same shared runtime
  route family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog instead of a
  Debezium-only endpoint family
- preflight currently remains read-only operator truth; it does not mean Cephalon already owns
  Kafka Connect write-path execution, automatic connector mutation, or managed-connector
  control-plane orchestration

## Managed-connector dry-run baseline

The `ENG-174` follow-through keeps managed-connector dry-run additive over that same shared
runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only dry-run planner.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorDryRun` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `deferred`, `blocked`, `no-op`, and `would-change` posture for
  Debezium-managed runtimes together with dry-run categories, the intended operation id, source
  coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan/write-path-readiness/preflight state, the
  current primary action id, and additive potential-change detail
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that dry-run answer from the already-shipped
  coverage, remediation, governance, drift, action-planning, write-path-readiness, and preflight
  truth, so observe-only, out-of-policy, incomplete-reporting, drifted, blocked,
  future-control-plane, and lifecycle-specific declarations can surface one consistent
  connector-management dry-run answer without claiming Kafka Connect write paths or automatic
  connector mutation
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/dry-runs/{dryRunState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/dry-runs/categories/{dryRunCategory}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/dry-runs/operations/{operationId}` on the same shared runtime
  route family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog instead of a
  Debezium-only endpoint family
- dry-run currently remains read-only operator truth; it does not mean Cephalon already owns
  Kafka Connect write-path execution, automatic connector mutation, or managed-connector
  control-plane orchestration

## Managed-connector execution-intent baseline

The `ENG-175` follow-through keeps managed-connector execution intent additive over that same
shared runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only execution planner.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorExecutionIntent` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `deferred`, `blocked`, `operator-action`, `requires-approval`, and
  `ready-to-execute` posture for Debezium-managed runtimes together with execution-intent
  categories, the intended operation id, source
  coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan/write-path-readiness/preflight/dry-run state,
  the current primary action id, the confidence-source id, and additive potential-change detail
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that execution-intent answer from the
  already-shipped coverage, remediation, governance, drift, action-planning, write-path
  readiness, preflight, and dry-run truth, so observe-only, out-of-policy,
  incomplete-reporting, blocking-remediation, reconcile-drift, and lifecycle-specific
  declarations can surface one consistent connector-management execution-intent answer without
  claiming Kafka Connect write paths or automatic connector mutation
- reconcile paths that would still apply future control-plane changes remain operator-owned on the
  shared surface, while lifecycle operations such as `pause` can now surface approval-gated or
  ready-to-execute future engine lanes when shared preflight truth is satisfied
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/execution-intents/{executionIntentState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/execution-intents/categories/{executionIntentCategory}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/execution-intents/operations/{operationId}` on the same shared
  runtime route family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog
  instead of a Debezium-only endpoint family
- execution intent currently remains read-only operator truth; it does not mean Cephalon already
  owns Kafka Connect write-path execution, automatic connector mutation, or managed-connector
  control-plane orchestration

## Managed-connector execution-approval baseline

The `ENG-176` follow-through keeps managed-connector execution approval and safety-gating
additive over that same shared runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only approval
registry.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorExecutionApproval` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `auto-blocked`, `policy-blocked`, `approval-required`, `approval-ready`, and
  `auto-eligible` posture for Debezium-managed runtimes together with execution-approval
  categories, the intended operation id, source
  coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan/write-path-readiness/preflight/dry-run/execution-intent
  state, the current primary action id, the safety-gating source id, and explicit-approval detail
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that execution-approval answer from the
  already-shipped coverage, remediation, governance, drift, action-planning, write-path
  readiness, preflight, dry-run, and execution-intent truth, so observe-only,
  out-of-policy, incomplete-reporting, blocking-remediation, lifecycle-specific, and destructive
  declarations can surface one consistent connector-management execution-approval answer without
  claiming Kafka Connect write paths or automatic connector mutation
- reconcile paths that still depend on a future control plane remain policy-blocked on the shared
  surface, lifecycle operations such as `pause` can now surface approval-ready truth, and
  destructive operations such as `delete` surface explicit approval-required truth before any
  future engine execution lane
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/execution-approvals/{executionApprovalState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/execution-approvals/categories/{executionApprovalCategory}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/execution-approvals/operations/{operationId}` on the same shared
  runtime route family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog
  instead of a Debezium-only endpoint family
- execution approval currently remains read-only operator truth; it does not mean Cephalon
  already owns Kafka Connect write-path execution, automatic connector mutation, or
  managed-connector control-plane orchestration

## Managed-connector write-path command-envelope baseline

The `ENG-177` follow-through keeps managed-connector write-path command envelopes additive over
that same shared runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only execution registry.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorCommandEnvelope` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `blocked`, `operator-only`, `approval-gated`, and `engine-ready` posture for
  Debezium-managed runtimes together with command-envelope categories, the intended operation id,
  source coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan/write-path-readiness/preflight/dry-run/
  execution-intent/execution-approval state, the current primary action id, source truth, target
  connector identity, deterministic command fingerprints, and safety flags
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that command-envelope answer from the
  already-shipped execution-approval, execution-intent, dry-run, preflight, write-path readiness,
  governance, drift, remediation, and coverage truth, so observe-only, out-of-policy,
  blocking-remediation, future-control-plane, approval-gated, and engine-ready declarations can
  surface one consistent connector-management command-envelope answer without claiming Kafka
  Connect write paths or automatic connector mutation
- reconcile paths that still depend on a future control plane now surface `operator-only`
  command-envelope truth, lifecycle operations such as `pause` can surface `approval-gated` or
  `engine-ready` envelopes, and destructive operations such as `delete` surface explicit
  destructive-envelope truth before any future engine execution lane
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-envelopes/{commandState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-envelopes/categories/{commandCategory}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-envelopes/operations/{operationId}` on the same shared
  runtime route family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog
  instead of a Debezium-only endpoint family
- command envelopes currently remain read-only operator truth; they do not mean Cephalon already
  owns Kafka Connect write-path execution, automatic connector mutation, or managed-connector
  control-plane orchestration

## Managed-connector command-issuance baseline

The `ENG-178` follow-through keeps managed-connector command issuance additive over that same
shared runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only issuance registry.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorCommandIssuance` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `blocked`, `operator-only`, `accepted`, `rejected`, and `issued` posture for
  Debezium-managed runtimes together with command-issuance categories, the intended operation id,
  source coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan/write-path-readiness/preflight/dry-run/
  execution-intent/execution-approval/command-envelope state, issuance source truth, target
  connector identity, deterministic command fingerprints, deterministic issuance fingerprints, and
  safety flags
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that command-issuance answer from the already
  shipped command-envelope, execution-approval, execution-intent, dry-run, preflight,
  write-path-readiness, governance, drift, remediation, and coverage truth, so observe-only,
  out-of-policy, blocking-remediation, future-control-plane, approval-gated, and no-op
  declarations can surface one consistent connector-management command-issuance answer without
  claiming Kafka Connect write paths or automatic connector mutation
- future-control-plane reconcile paths now surface `operator-only` command-issuance truth,
  approval-gated lifecycle operations such as `pause` or `delete` surface `accepted` issuance
  posture, and no-op engine-ready answers can surface `rejected` issuance truth before any future
  provider execution lane is added
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-issuances/{issuanceState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-issuances/categories/{issuanceCategory}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-issuances/operations/{operationId}` on the same shared
  runtime route family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog instead
  of a Debezium-only endpoint family
- command issuance currently remains shared read-only operator truth; it does not mean Cephalon
  already owns Kafka Connect write-path execution, automatic connector mutation, or
  managed-connector control-plane orchestration

## Managed-connector provider execution-adapter baseline

The `ENG-179` follow-through keeps provider execution-adapter truth additive over that same shared
runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only transport registry or second coordinator.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorExecutionAdapter` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `blocked`, `operator-only`, `unavailable`, and `ready` posture for
  Debezium-managed runtimes together with execution-adapter categories, the intended operation id,
  source coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan/write-path-readiness/preflight/dry-run/
  execution-intent/execution-approval/command-envelope/command-issuance state, adapter identity,
  deterministic adapter fingerprints, and provider-ready safety flags
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that execution-adapter answer from the already
  shipped command-issuance, command-envelope, execution-approval, execution-intent, dry-run,
  preflight, write-path-readiness, governance, drift, remediation, and coverage truth, so
  observe-only, out-of-policy, blocking-remediation, future-control-plane, approval-gated, and
  no-op declarations can surface one consistent provider-readiness answer before Cephalon ever
  claims Kafka Connect ownership
- `DebeziumManagedConnectorExecutionAdapter` now proves the first provider lane by translating
  shared pause/resume/restart/delete intent into Debezium or Kafka Connect REST command shape,
  while reconcile truthfully remains blocked until a later configuration-payload lane exists
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/execution-adapters/{executionAdapterState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/execution-adapters/categories/{executionAdapterCategory}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/execution-adapters/operations/{operationId}` on the same shared
  runtime route family, and additive
  `POST /engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/{executionRuntimeId}/commands/{operationId}` now returns a
  typed shared command-execution result instead of branching into a Debezium-only endpoint family
- provider command translation currently remains a bounded adapter seam; it does not mean Cephalon
  already owns Kafka Connect execution outcomes, automatic reconcile loops, retries, idempotency,
  or broader managed-connector control-plane orchestration

## Managed-connector execution outcome/history baseline

The `ENG-180` follow-through keeps latest managed-connector command outcome plus bounded recent
history additive on that same shared runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only command
journal or second coordinator.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorCommandExecution` now publishes the latest
  shared command-execution answer for Debezium-managed runtimes, including stable
  `not-applicable`, `unrecorded`, `blocked`, `operator-only`, `unavailable`, `no-op`, `adapted`,
  and `failed` posture together with requested versus resolved operation ids, deterministic
  fingerprints, and recorded attempt metadata such as `AttemptId`, `RecordedAtUtc`, and
  `HasRecordedOutcome`
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now keeps that latest outcome plus bounded recent history on
  the same merged CDC runtime surface, and `ICdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeCatalog` now exposes
  command-execution state filters, operation filters, and per-runtime command-execution history
  without forcing Debezium callers to invent a parallel history registry
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-executions/{executionState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-executions/operations/{operationId}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/{executionRuntimeId}/command-executions` on the same shared route
  family, while the additive `POST /engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/{executionRuntimeId}/commands/{operationId}`
  lane from `ENG-179` now records the resulting shared outcome instead of only returning a transient
  command result
- Debezium command translation still stays immediate and bounded: pause, resume, restart, and delete
  requests can translate into provider command shape, reconcile remains blocked until a later
  configuration-payload lane exists, and the new history surface records those typed outcomes
  without claiming automatic retries or durable provider completion tracking

## Managed-connector retry/idempotency hardening baseline

The `ENG-181` follow-through keeps shared retry and idempotency posture additive over that same
shared runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only retry registry or second
coordinator.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorCommandRetry` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `not-needed`, `duplicate`, `cooldown`, `retry-blocked`, `operator-only`, and
  `retry-eligible` posture for Debezium-managed runtimes together with retry categories, the
  intended operation id, source coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan/
  write-path-readiness/preflight/dry-run/execution-intent/execution-approval/command-envelope/
  command-issuance/execution-adapter/latest-command-execution state, deterministic retry
  fingerprints, cooldown windows, and latest attempt metadata
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that command-retry answer from the already
  shipped command-execution history, command-issuance, execution-adapter, and approval posture, so
  cooldown, duplicate, no-op, operator-only, and retry-eligible answers surface back on the same
  merged CDC runtime surface instead of forcing Debezium callers to invent a parallel retry cache
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-retries/{retryState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-retries/categories/{retryCategory}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-retries/operations/{operationId}` on the same shared route
  family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog instead of a
  Debezium-only endpoint family
- Debezium pause/delete command history now proves bounded cooldown and duplicate posture through
  the shared fingerprint lane, while future-control-plane reconcile paths still surface
  `operator-only` retry truth instead of pretending Cephalon already owns Kafka Connect retry
  orchestration
- command retry currently remains read-only retry evidence on its own; actual automatic background
  retry execution now stays behind the shared retry-execution-policy, command-journal, and opt-in
  automatic-retry lane rather than a Debezium-only retry loop

## Managed-connector retry-execution policy baseline

The `ENG-182` follow-through keeps shared retry-execution policy additive over that same shared
runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only retry-policy registry or second
coordinator.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorRetryExecutionPolicy` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `not-needed`, `cooldown`, `manual-approval`, `policy-blocked`,
  `operator-only`, and `background-retry-disabled` posture for Debezium-managed runtimes together
  with policy categories, the intended operation id, source coverage/remediation/governance/drift/
  action-plan/write-path-readiness/preflight/dry-run/execution-intent/execution-approval/
  command-envelope/command-issuance/execution-adapter/latest-command-execution state, deterministic
  retry fingerprints, cooldown windows, and latest attempt metadata
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that retry-execution-policy answer from the
  already shipped command-retry, command-execution history, command-issuance, execution-adapter,
  command-envelope, and approval posture, so cooldown, manual-approval, policy-blocked, and
  automatic-retry-disabled answers surface back on the same merged CDC runtime surface instead of
  forcing Debezium callers to invent a parallel retry-policy cache
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/retry-execution-policies/{policyState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/retry-execution-policies/categories/{policyCategory}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/retry-execution-policies/operations/{operationId}` on the same
  shared route family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog instead
  of a Debezium-only endpoint family
- Debezium reconcile and pause command history now proves shared `policy-blocked` and
  `manual-approval` posture after cooldown on the existing provider-translation lane, while
  retry-eligible paths still surface `background-retry-disabled` truth instead of pretending
  Cephalon already owns automatic background retry execution
- retry-execution policy currently remains safety and governance truth on its own; actual automatic
  background retry execution is a separate shared lane and still does not mean Cephalon already
  owns durable distributed command journals or full managed-connector retry orchestration

## Managed-connector bounded command-journal baseline

The `ENG-183` follow-through keeps shared bounded command-journal truth additive over that same
shared runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only durable journal or second
coordinator.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorCommandJournal` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `empty`, `bounded`, `truncated`, `cooldown-active`,
  `duplicate-evidence-present`, and `insufficient-for-automation` posture for Debezium-managed
  runtimes together with journal categories, the intended operation id, source
  coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan/write-path-readiness/preflight/dry-run/
  execution-intent/execution-approval/command-envelope/command-issuance/execution-adapter/
  latest-command-execution/command-retry/retry-execution-policy state, retained-versus-recorded
  history counts, deterministic retry and command fingerprint matching, cooldown windows, and
  latest-versus-oldest retained attempt metadata
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that command-journal answer from the already
  shipped command-execution history, command-retry posture, and retry-execution-policy posture, so
  empty history, bounded retained history, truncated retained history, cooldown-backed history,
  duplicate-evidence history, and still-insufficient automation history surface back on the same
  merged CDC runtime surface instead of forcing Debezium callers to invent a parallel durable
  journal or history-governance cache
- ASP.NET Core now maps `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-journals/{journalState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/command-journals/categories/{journalCategory}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/{executionRuntimeId}/command-journal` on the same shared route
  family, so operator drill-down stays aligned with the engine-owned catalog instead of a
  Debezium-only endpoint family
- Debezium pause/delete command history now proves shared cooldown and duplicate-evidence journal
  posture, repeated reconcile command history now proves shared truncated bounded-history posture,
  and future-control-plane reconcile paths still surface `insufficient-for-automation` truth
  instead of pretending Cephalon already owns automatic background retries or a durable
  distributed command journal
- bounded command-journal posture currently remains automation-readiness truth on its own; actual
  automatic background retry execution is a separate shared lane and still does not mean Cephalon
  already owns durable distributed command journals or full managed-connector idempotency
  orchestration

## Managed-connector automatic background retry execution baseline

The `ENG-184` follow-through keeps shared automatic background retry execution additive over that
same shared runtime surface instead of introducing a Debezium-only retry loop, durable
distributed scheduler, or second coordinator.

- `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryExecution` now publishes
  stable `not-applicable`, `disabled`, `blocked`, `eligible`, and `completed` posture for
  Debezium-managed runtimes together with automatic-retry categories, the intended operation id,
  source coverage/remediation/governance/drift/action-plan/write-path-readiness/preflight/dry-run/
  execution-intent/execution-approval/command-envelope/command-issuance/execution-adapter/
  latest-command-execution/command-retry/retry-execution-policy/command-journal state,
  deterministic command, retry, and execution fingerprints, latest automatic-attempt metadata,
  operator-versus-automatic invocation-source truth, cooldown windows, and matching approval or
  destructive-allowance reuse flags
- the shared execution-runtime catalog now derives that automatic background retry answer from the
  already shipped retry-execution-policy, command-journal, command-retry, and command-execution
  history truth, so disabled, blocked, eligible, and already-completed answers surface back on the
  same merged CDC runtime surface instead of forcing Debezium callers to invent a parallel retry
  loop or scheduler
- the shared data pack now exposes that bounded retry lane through
  `EnableManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryExecution`,
  `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryPollingIntervalSeconds`, and
  `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService`, so hosts can opt into one shared in-process retry
  loop without re-implementing provider-specific polling
- Debezium-managed restart/pause/resume/delete command paths now participate in that shared
  automatic background retry lane through the existing execution-adapter seam, while targeted
  coverage proves shared approval reuse, automatic-attempt recording, and completed retry posture
  on the same runtime surface
- the `ENG-185` follow-through keeps that same bounded retry lane coordination-aware:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryCoordination` now publishes
  stable `not-applicable`, `single-node`, `uncoordinated`, `lease-held`, `lease-missing`,
  `conflicted`, and `operator-only` posture together with coordination categories,
  coordination-owner id, active-reporter id, reporter-lease timing, and
  `CanExecuteOnCurrentNode`, and the shared execution-runtime catalog derives that answer from the
  already shipped execution ownership, execution topology, reporter-coordination, automatic-retry,
  retry-execution-policy, and command-journal truth instead of forcing Debezium callers to invent
  a parallel cross-node retry coordinator
- the shared data pack now scopes that bounded retry lane through
  `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryCoordinationOwnerId`, so `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService`
  and automatic invocations in `ManagedConnectorCommandExecutor` only run on the host that
  truthfully owns the active retry lease; owner-mismatch or lease-missing runtimes stay
  eligible-but-uncoordinated without recording duplicate automatic attempts
- the `ENG-186` follow-through keeps that same bounded retry lane durable across restart:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorCommandJournalDurability` now publishes
  stable `not-applicable`, `in-memory-only`, `persisted`, `recovered`, `recovery-failed`, and
  `persistence-failed` posture together with durability categories, persistence path,
  persisted-versus-recovered timestamps, retained-versus-recorded history counts, and
  persisted-or-recovered history flags, and the shared execution-runtime catalog derives that
  answer from the already shipped command-journal, automatic-retry, and coordination truth plus
  the bounded history store instead of forcing Debezium callers to invent a parallel persistence
  subsystem
- the shared data pack now exposes that bounded durable lane through
  `ManagedConnectorCommandJournalPersistencePath`, so `ManagedConnectorCommandExecutionHistoryStore`
  can persist and recover bounded retry evidence across host restart while the existing Debezium
  managed-connector route family continues to publish truth through the shared CDC runtime surface
- the `ENG-187` follow-through keeps that same bounded retry lane honest in multi-node topology:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorDistributedRetryLease` now publishes stable
  `not-applicable`, `single-node`, `lease-held`, `lease-missing`, `lease-conflicted`,
  `idempotent-safe`, `idempotency-risk`, and `operator-only` posture together with coordination
  owner, active reporter, retry fingerprint, retained-attempt, duplicate-attempt, and durable
  journal evidence so the shared execution-runtime catalog can block automatic retry when
  cross-node idempotency is still in-memory-only or duplicated even though raw coordination remains
  lease-held
- the `ENG-188` follow-through keeps that same bounded retry lane orchestration-aware:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorDistributedRetryOrchestration` now
  publishes stable `not-applicable`, `disabled`, `operator-only`, `cooldown`, `blocked`,
  `scheduled`, and `completed` posture together with scheduler identity, polling cadence,
  orchestration owner, active reporter, retry fingerprint, durable-history evidence, and
  `CanScheduleAutomaticRetryOnCurrentNode`, so the shared execution-runtime catalog can drive the
  existing bounded automatic retry loop from one shared answer instead of provider-local scheduler
  checks
- the `ENG-189` follow-through keeps that same bounded retry lane safer across nodes:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorCrossNodeIdempotencyHardening` now
  publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `idempotent-safe`, `stale-owner-risk`,
  `duplicate-lineage-risk`, and `replay-window-risk` posture together with coordination owner,
  active reporter, retry fingerprint, retained-lineage and automatic-attempt evidence,
  durable-history truth, and `CanExecuteAutomaticRetryOnCurrentNode`, so the shared
  execution-runtime catalog can keep distributed retry orchestration blocked when raw lease truth
  still looks good but cross-node lineage or replay evidence says retry would not yet be safe
- the `ENG-190` follow-through keeps that same bounded retry lane broader multi-node
  lease-execution-aware: `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorMultiNodeLeaseExecution`
  now publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `single-node`, `lease-executable`,
  `lease-blocked`, `lease-conflicted`, and `stale-lease-risk` posture together with coordination
  owner, active reporter, scheduler identity, polling cadence, retry fingerprint, latest
  automatic-attempt evidence, and `CanExecuteAutomaticRetryOnCurrentNode`, so the shared
  execution-runtime catalog can gate both `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService` and
  automatic command execution through one broader lease-execution answer instead of trusting
  distributed retry orchestration alone
- the `ENG-191` follow-through keeps that same bounded retry lane durable shared
  scheduler-orchestration-aware: `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorDurableSharedSchedulerOrchestration`
  now publishes stable `not-applicable`, `disabled`, `operator-only`, `unscheduled`, `scheduled`,
  `lease-blocked`, `recovery-needed`, and `scheduler-conflicted` posture together with
  coordination owner, active reporter, scheduler identity and kind, polling cadence, retry
  fingerprint, latest automatic-attempt evidence, durable-history truth, and
  `CanScheduleAutomaticRetryOnCurrentNode`, so the shared execution-runtime catalog can gate both
  `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService` and automatic command execution through one
  scheduler answer instead of trusting broader multi-node lease-execution truth alone
- the `ENG-192` follow-through keeps that same bounded retry lane scheduler-recovery and
  execution-hardening-aware: `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorSchedulerRecoveryExecutionHardening`
  now publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `recovery-ready`, `recovery-blocked`,
  `replaying`, `execution-hardened`, and `execution-risk` posture together with coordination owner,
  active reporter, durable shared scheduler state, broader multi-node lease-execution state,
  distributed retry orchestration state, command-journal durability state, latest command-execution
  truth, scheduler identity and kind, retry fingerprint, latest automatic-attempt evidence, and
  `CanExecuteAutomaticRetryOnCurrentNode`, so the shared execution-runtime catalog can gate both
  `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService` and automatic command execution through one merged
  recovery answer instead of trusting durable shared scheduler truth alone when durable evidence or
  latest automatic execution still says the current node is blocked or risky
- the `ENG-193` follow-through keeps that same bounded retry and command lane broader
  provider-owned-write-path-aware: `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorProviderOwnedWritePathExecution`
  now publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `provider-executable`,
  `provider-blocked`, `provider-owned-executing`, `provider-owned-completed`, and
  `provider-owned-risk` posture together with management mode, operation/source, execution-adapter
  plus latest-command plus retry-policy plus automatic-retry plus lease plus scheduler plus
  recovery state, adapter/provider metadata, deterministic fingerprints, approval/destructive/
  change metadata, and `CanExecuteProviderOwnedWritePathOnCurrentNode`, so the shared
  execution-runtime catalog can gate both `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService` and
  automatic command execution through one merged provider-owned write-path answer instead of
  trusting scheduler recovery truth alone when the provider lane still reports blocked or risky
- ASP.NET Core now maps
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-owned-write-path-executions/{providerExecutionState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-owned-write-path-executions/categories/{providerExecutionCategory}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-owned-write-path-executions/operations/{operationId}`,
  and `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/{executionRuntimeId}/provider-owned-write-path-execution` on
  that same shared route family instead of branching into a Debezium-only control-plane endpoint
  set
- the `ENG-194` follow-through keeps that same bounded retry and command lane broader
  provider-execution-orchestration-aware:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorProviderExecutionOrchestration` now
  publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `orchestration-ready`,
  `orchestration-blocked`, `orchestration-executing`, `orchestration-completed`, and
  `orchestration-risk` posture together with operation/source, provider-owned write-path plus
  execution-adapter plus latest-command plus retry-policy plus command-journal plus durable shared
  scheduler plus scheduler-recovery state, deterministic fingerprints, adapter/provider metadata,
  and `CanOrchestrateProviderExecutionOnCurrentNode`, so the shared execution-runtime catalog can
  gate both `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService` and automatic command execution through
  one merged provider execution orchestration answer instead of trusting provider-owned write-path
  truth alone when the broader orchestration lane still reports blocked or risky
- ASP.NET Core now maps
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-execution-orchestrations/{providerExecutionOrchestrationState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-execution-orchestrations/categories/{providerExecutionOrchestrationCategory}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-execution-orchestrations/operations/{operationId}`, and
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/{executionRuntimeId}/provider-execution-orchestration` on that
  same shared route family instead of branching into a Debezium-only orchestration endpoint set
- `ENG-195` now keeps the shared managed-connector provider-owned control-plane ownership lane
  provider-owned-control-plane-ownership-aware:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorProviderOwnedControlPlaneOwnership` now
  publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `ownership-ready`, `ownership-blocked`,
  `ownership-active`, `ownership-partial`, and `ownership-risk` posture together with
  operation/source, provider execution orchestration plus provider-owned write-path plus
  execution-adapter plus latest-command plus retry-policy plus command-journal plus durable shared
  scheduler plus scheduler-recovery state, deterministic fingerprints, adapter/provider metadata,
  approval/destructive/change metadata, durable-history evidence, and
  `CanExerciseProviderOwnedControlPlaneOnCurrentNode`, so the shared execution-runtime catalog can
  gate both `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService` and automatic command execution through
  one merged provider-owned control-plane ownership answer instead of trusting broader provider
  execution orchestration truth alone when the ownership lane still reports blocked or risky
- ASP.NET Core now maps
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-owned-control-plane-ownership/{providerOwnedControlPlaneOwnershipState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-owned-control-plane-ownership/categories/{providerOwnedControlPlaneOwnershipCategory}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-owned-control-plane-ownership/operations/{operationId}`,
  and `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/{executionRuntimeId}/provider-owned-control-plane-ownership`
  on that same shared route family instead of branching into a Debezium-only ownership endpoint
  set
- `ENG-196` now keeps that shared managed-connector provider-owned control-plane lane
  mutation/reconcile-aware:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorProviderOwnedControlPlaneMutationReconcile`
  now publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `mutation-ready`, `reconcile-ready`,
  `mutation-blocked`, `reconcile-blocked`, `mutation-executing`, and `mutation-risk` posture
  together with operation/source, provider-owned control-plane ownership plus provider execution
  orchestration plus provider-owned write-path plus command-envelope plus command-issuance plus
  latest-command plus retry-policy plus command-journal state, deterministic fingerprints,
  adapter/provider metadata, approval/destructive/change metadata, durable-history evidence, and
  `CanMutateOrReconcileOnCurrentNode`, so the shared execution-runtime catalog can gate both
  `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService` and automatic command execution through one merged
  provider-owned control-plane mutation/reconcile answer instead of trusting broader provider-owned
  control-plane ownership truth alone when the mutation/reconcile lane still reports blocked or
  risky
- ASP.NET Core now maps
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-owned-control-plane-mutation-reconcile/{providerOwnedControlPlaneMutationReconcileState}`,
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-owned-control-plane-mutation-reconcile/categories/{providerOwnedControlPlaneMutationReconcileCategory}`,

  on that same shared route family instead of branching into a Debezium-only mutation/reconcile
  endpoint set
- `ENG-197` now keeps that same shared managed-connector provider-owned control-plane lane
  provisioning-aware:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorProviderOwnedControlPlaneProvisioning` now
  publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `provisioning-ready`,
  `provisioning-blocked`, `provisioning-executing`, `provisioning-partial`, and
  `provisioning-risk` posture together with operation/source, provider-owned control-plane
  mutation/reconcile plus provider-owned control-plane ownership plus provider execution
  orchestration plus provider-owned write-path plus command-envelope plus command-issuance plus
  latest-command plus retry-policy plus command-journal state, deterministic fingerprints,
  adapter/provider metadata, approval/destructive/change metadata, durable-history evidence, and
  `CanProvisionProviderOwnedControlPlaneOnCurrentNode`, so the shared execution-runtime catalog can
  gate both `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService` and automatic command execution through
  one merged provider-owned control-plane provisioning answer instead of trusting broader
  provider-owned control-plane mutation/reconcile truth alone when the provisioning lane still
  reports blocked, partial, or risky
- ASP.NET Core now maps
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-owned-control-plane-provisioning/{providerOwnedControlPlaneProvisioningState}`,

  on that same shared route family instead of branching into a Debezium-only provisioning
  endpoint set
- `ENG-198` now keeps that same shared managed-connector provider-owned control-plane lane
  apply-and-reconcile-aware:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorProviderOwnedControlPlaneApplyAndReconcileExecution`
  now publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `apply-and-reconcile-ready`,
  `apply-and-reconcile-blocked`, `apply-and-reconcile-executing`,
  `apply-and-reconcile-completed`, and `apply-and-reconcile-risk` posture together with

  mutation/reconcile plus provider-owned control-plane ownership plus provider execution
  orchestration plus provider-owned write-path plus command-envelope plus command-issuance plus
  latest-command plus retry-policy plus command-journal state, deterministic fingerprints,
  adapter/provider metadata, approval/destructive/change metadata, durable-history evidence, and
  `CanExecuteProviderOwnedControlPlaneApplyAndReconcileOnCurrentNode`, so the shared
  execution-runtime catalog can gate both `ManagedConnectorAutomaticRetryHostedService` and
  automatic command execution through one merged provider-owned control-plane apply-and-reconcile
  execution answer instead of trusting broader provider-owned control-plane provisioning truth
  alone when the apply-and-reconcile lane still reports blocked, completed, or risky
- ASP.NET Core now maps
  `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes/provider-owned-control-plane-apply-and-reconcile-executions/{applyAndReconcileExecutionState}`,

- `ENG-199` now keeps that same shared managed-connector provider-owned control-plane lane
  dependency-aware:
  `CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimeDescriptor.ManagedConnectorProviderOwnedControlPlaneDependencyAwareApplyAndReconcileHardening`
  now publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `dependency-ready`,
  `dependency-blocked`, `dependency-degraded`, `apply-and-reconcile-hardened`, and
  `dependency-risk` posture together with operation/source, broader provider-owned control-plane
  apply-and-reconcile plus provisioning plus mutation/reconcile plus ownership plus execution
  orchestration plus write-path truth, governance and drift posture, latest command plus
  retry-policy plus command-journal evidence, declared-versus-reported dependency identity and
  task-topology metadata, active reporter-lease evidence, durable-history signals, and
  `CanExecuteDependencyAwareApplyAndReconcileOnCurrentNode`, so the shared execution-runtime
  catalog can answer one dependency-aware hardening posture without pushing Debezium-specific
  connector identity, task topology, or lease logic into another control-plane subsystem

- `ENG-200` now keeps that same shared managed-connector provider-owned control-plane lane
  dependency-aware across provisioning and mutation:

  now publishes stable `not-applicable`, `operator-only`, `dependency-ready`,

- `ENG-203` now keeps that same shared managed-connector control-plane lane explicit about how to
  drill into the shipped Debezium provider-specific identities without inventing a Debezium-only
  operator API: the shared execution-runtime catalog and ASP.NET Core route family now expose
  provider-surface and connector filters for both
  `ManagedConnectorProviderSpecificControlPlaneMaterializer` and
  `ManagedConnectorProviderSpecificControlPlaneDependencyAwareTeardownAndMutationExecutionHardening`,
  so operators can move directly from `debezium-kafka-connect-rest` surface identity or a stable
  connector id to the matching runtime on the same shared CDC runtime story
- `ENG-204` now keeps worker identity truthful on that same shared lane even when Debezium reports
  omit a raw `workerId`: the report sink now falls back to the stable external `reporterId`, the
  shared execution-runtime catalog resolves the best available provider-specific worker id from
  normalized metadata plus active reporter truth, and both provider-specific control-plane answers
  now keep `WorkerId`, `HasWorkerIdentity`, and `WorkerIdentityVisible` posture aligned on the same
  shared runtime story
- `ENG-205` now keeps that same shared managed-connector control-plane lane explicit about how to
  drill into shipped Debezium worker identity without inventing a Debezium-only operator API: the
  shared execution-runtime catalog and ASP.NET Core route family now expose
  `/workers/{workerId}` filters for both
  `ManagedConnectorProviderSpecificControlPlaneMaterializer` and
  `ManagedConnectorProviderSpecificControlPlaneDependencyAwareTeardownAndMutationExecutionHardening`,
  so operators can move directly from a stable Kafka Connect worker id to the matching runtime on
  the same shared CDC runtime story
- `ENG-206` now keeps that same shared managed-connector control-plane lane explicit about how to
  drill into shipped Debezium transport identity without inventing a Debezium-only operator API:
  the shared execution-runtime catalog and ASP.NET Core route family now expose
  `/transports/{transportKind}` filters for both
  `ManagedConnectorProviderSpecificControlPlaneMaterializer` and
  `ManagedConnectorProviderSpecificControlPlaneDependencyAwareTeardownAndMutationExecutionHardening`,
  so operators can move directly from the stable `http-rest` transport kind to the matching runtime
  on the same shared CDC runtime story
- `ENG-207` now keeps that same shared managed-connector control-plane lane explicit about how to
  drill into shipped Debezium dependency identity without inventing a Debezium-only operator API:
  the shared execution-runtime catalog and ASP.NET Core route family now expose
  `/connect-clusters/{connectClusterId}`, `/connector-classes/{connectorClass}`, and
  `/source-providers/{sourceProviderId}` filters for both
  `ManagedConnectorProviderSpecificControlPlaneMaterializer` and
  `ManagedConnectorProviderSpecificControlPlaneDependencyAwareTeardownAndMutationExecutionHardening`,
  so operators can move directly from the stable Kafka Connect cluster id, connector class, or
  source-provider id to the matching runtime on the same shared CDC runtime story
- `ENG-208` now keeps that same shared managed-connector control-plane lane explicit about how to
  drill into shipped current-node provider posture without inventing a Debezium-only operator API:
  the shared execution-runtime catalog and ASP.NET Core route family now expose
  `/current-nodes/{canUseOnCurrentNode}` for
  `ManagedConnectorProviderSpecificControlPlaneMaterializer`, plus
  `/current-nodes/{canExecuteOnCurrentNode}`,
  `/current-nodes/teardowns/{canExecuteTeardownOnCurrentNode}`, and
  `/current-nodes/mutation-executions/{canExecuteMutationExecutionOnCurrentNode}` for
  `ManagedConnectorProviderSpecificControlPlaneDependencyAwareTeardownAndMutationExecutionHardening`,
  so operators can move directly from blocked-versus-executable Debezium node posture to the
  matching runtime on the same shared CDC runtime story
- bounded automatic background retry execution still remains shared in-process truth, and the
  shipped broader provider-owned write-path execution posture plus broader provider execution

  hardening posture plus broader provider-owned control-plane dependency-aware provisioning and
  mutation hardening posture plus broader provider-specific control-plane materializer posture
  plus broader provider-specific control-plane dependency-aware teardown and mutation-execution
  hardening posture still does not mean Cephalon already owns durable distributed command
  journals, durable distributed schedulers, or full Kafka Connect provisioning and
  apply-and-reconcile ownership

## Not shipped in these slices

This pack intentionally still does not claim:

- Kafka Connect or Debezium REST API provisioning and apply-and-reconcile ownership beyond the
  shipped shared provider-owned control-plane dependency-aware apply-and-reconcile hardening
  posture plus the shipped shared provider-owned control-plane dependency-aware provisioning and
  mutation hardening posture plus the shipped shared provider-specific control-plane materializer
  posture plus the shipped shared provider-specific control-plane dependency-aware teardown and
  mutation-execution hardening posture
- broader managed-connector control-plane provisioning ownership beyond the shipped shared
  provider-owned write-path execution posture plus the shipped shared provider execution
  orchestration posture plus the shipped shared provider-owned control-plane ownership posture plus
  the shipped shared provider-owned control-plane mutation/reconcile posture plus the shipped
  shared provider-owned control-plane provisioning posture plus the shipped shared
  provider-owned control-plane apply-and-reconcile execution posture plus the shipped shared
  provider-owned control-plane dependency-aware apply-and-reconcile hardening posture plus the
  shipped shared provider-owned control-plane dependency-aware provisioning and mutation
  hardening posture plus the shipped shared provider-specific control-plane materializer posture
  plus the shipped shared provider-specific control-plane dependency-aware teardown and
  mutation-execution hardening posture
- automatic managed-connector drift correction or write-path remediation
- per-task execution graphs or hosted executions inside Cephalon
- durable distributed command journals, durable distributed retry schedulers, or full idempotency
  orchestration beyond the shipped shared bounded command-journal plus durable journal posture plus
  bounded automatic background retry plus coordination posture plus distributed retry lease truth
  plus distributed retry orchestration truth plus richer cross-node idempotency hardening plus
  broader multi-node lease execution plus durable shared scheduler orchestration plus scheduler
  recovery hardening plus broader provider-owned write-path execution posture plus broader
  provider execution orchestration posture plus broader provider-owned control-plane ownership
  posture plus broader provider-owned control-plane mutation/reconcile posture plus broader
  provider-owned control-plane provisioning posture plus broader provider-owned control-plane
  apply-and-reconcile execution posture plus broader provider-owned control-plane
  dependency-aware apply-and-reconcile hardening posture plus broader provider-owned control-plane
  dependency-aware provisioning and mutation hardening posture plus broader
  provider-specific control-plane materializer posture plus broader provider-specific
  control-plane dependency-aware teardown and mutation-execution hardening posture
- schema-registry management or event serialization policy outside the shared CDC runtime metadata
- provider-native read/write storage or outbox implementation

These remain later slices so the current provider claim stays truthful.
