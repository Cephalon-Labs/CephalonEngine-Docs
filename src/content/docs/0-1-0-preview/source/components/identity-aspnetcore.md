`Cephalon.Identity.AspNetCore` is the ASP.NET Core host adapter for Cephalon identity and authorization.

## What it owns

- maps `ClaimsPrincipal`, route values, and request metadata into the shared Cephalon authorization contracts
- keeps ASP.NET Core-specific claim parsing, route parsing, and endpoint-filter behavior out of `Cephalon.Abstractions`
- provides `AddCephalonIdentityAspNetCore(...)` host wiring for `IServiceCollection` and `WebApplicationBuilder`
- provides low-ceremony REST helpers, `RequireCephalonAuthorization(...)` and `WithCephalonAuthenticationSchemes(...)`, for minimal API endpoints and route groups
- provides a low-ceremony `[RequireCephalonAuthorization]` attribute for controller and action boundaries so MVC-style consumer apps do not have to hand-roll filters or evaluator calls
- returns truthful `401` and `403` API responses without pretending to own consumer authentication schemes, and now defers to ASP.NET Core challenge/forbid flows when the host or endpoint metadata already declares authentication schemes
- respects ASP.NET Core `AllowAnonymous` endpoint metadata so public child endpoints can still opt out cleanly inside protected route groups
- stays deterministic even when the built-in `Cephalon.Identity` evaluator is disabled, so protected endpoints deny cleanly instead of drifting into missing-service failures while a consumer is wiring a custom evaluator
- projects an `identity-aspnetcore` runtime surface under `identity-access` so `/engine/technology-surfaces` can answer how many ASP.NET Core endpoints are protected, which policy ids are in play, and where `AllowAnonymous` overrides still exist
- bridges the current authenticated ASP.NET Core principal into `Cephalon.Audit` automatically when both packs are active and the consumer host has not already supplied a custom `IAuditActorAccessor`

## Main surfaces

- `Configuration/IdentityAspNetCoreOptions.cs`
- `Hosting/IdentityAspNetCoreServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`
- `Hosting/IdentityAspNetCoreWebApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs`
- `Transports/Rest/IdentityEndpointConventionBuilderExtensions.cs`
- `Transports/Rest/RequireCephalonAuthorizationAttribute.cs`

## How it fits

This package is the host-specific follow-through for the `Cephalon.Identity` baseline. The host-agnostic package already owns the authorization evaluator, policy metadata conventions, diagnostics ids, and the `identity-authorization` runtime surface. `Cephalon.Identity.AspNetCore` does the thin host work on top of that: it reads the current ASP.NET Core principal, extracts route and request context, and turns those into `AuthorizationSubject`, `AuthorizationResource`, and `AuthorizationContext` before asking the shared `IAuthorizationEvaluator` for the final answer.

That split matters because Cephalon wants consumer apps to stay low ceremony without hardwiring one host model into the engine core. A team can configure its own authentication schemes, tokens, cookies, or external identity provider however it wants, then let this adapter translate the current request into the shared Cephalon authorization contract at the HTTP boundary. The same boundary adapter now also gives `Cephalon.Audit` an honest low-ceremony ambient actor path by projecting the authenticated principal into the audit actor contract when the audit pack is active, without taking ownership away from hosts that already register a custom actor accessor.

The current slice is intentionally REST-only, but it now covers both minimal APIs and controller actions. It does not replace ASP.NET Core authentication, it does not infer product-specific business resources from the database, and it does not introduce a parallel security model. Instead, it focuses on one honest job: reduce repeated authorization plumbing at the HTTP boundary while preserving the existing host-agnostic Cephalon policy story and surfacing boundary truth through runtime introspection. The audit bridge follows the same rule: it makes authenticated principal data available to the audit baseline, but it does not claim durable history storage, workflow approvals, or business-specific audit policy.
