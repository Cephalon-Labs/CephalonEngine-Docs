`Cephalon.Data.EntityFramework` is the first provider-backed data companion pack for Cephalon.

## What it owns

- registers Entity Framework Core `DbContext` services through companion-pack registration instead of host-specific startup code
- supports either one shared `DbContext` or distinct read/write `DbContext` types for CQRS-oriented workloads
- exposes an opt-in Entity Framework-backed inbox that persists processed inbound messages through the active write-side `DbContext`
- exposes an opt-in Entity Framework-backed outbox that persists staged `OutboxMessage` rows through the active write-side `DbContext`
- exposes an adapter-neutral Entity Framework-backed `IEventDispatchStore` for pending staged outbox rows when the eventing package is present
- can enable official `Sfid.EntityFramework` conventions and save-time key assignment for typed `Sfid` identifiers
- publishes capability metadata that makes the active provider and read/write `DbContext` roles introspectable
- consumes `Engine:Databases` write/read role topology through the topology-aware registration overloads instead of inventing a second physical-layout contract
- can execute startup schema apply for the registered write/read `DbContext` roles when `Engine:Databases:Migrations:ApplyOnStartup` is enabled
- contributes first-class resolved database-role runtime state through `IDatabaseRoleCatalog`, `/engine/database-roles`, and `snapshot.DatabaseRoles`, including live connectivity plus pending-migration diagnostics for registered `DbContext` roles together with stable physical-target ids, display names, and physical co-location answers
- honors the engine-owned `RoleProbeFreshnessSeconds` runtime contract for EF-backed role probes, including additive caching, explicit live-versus-cache metadata, and migration-state cache invalidation
- contributes first-class database-migration descriptors and runtime state through `IDatabaseMigrationCatalog`, `/engine/database-migrations`, and `snapshot.DatabaseMigrations`
- contributes operator-facing EF Core bundle/script/update command templates per migration target so deploy-time guidance stays attached to the same runtime catalog
- publishes typed recommended migration ordering hints per logical target so operator playbooks can consume one engine-owned sequence instead of hardcoding `write` / `read` / `history` locally
- contributes the resolved physical-target truth that lets the engine-owned migration playbook and topology posture surface physical-target execution groups, grouped command paths, combined command batches, and warnings when multiple EF-backed logical migration targets share one physical database and still need coordinated deploy-time execution
- mirrors resolved-role runtime truth onto each migration descriptor through typed `RoleHealthState`, `RoleHealthDescription`, `RoleMigrationState`, `RoleMigrationDescription`, and `RoleObservedAtUtc` fields while preserving compatibility metadata for existing consumers
- populates typed migration-command operator metadata such as `ToolId`, `ExecutionCategory`, and `WorkingDirectoryHint` on the shared `DatabaseMigrationCommandDescriptor` contract while preserving additive metadata for provider-specific details
- provides the role-resolution and migration-registration primitives consumed by `Cephalon.Audit.EntityFramework` for the first durable `history` role follow-through
- publishes an operator-facing inbox descriptor through `/engine/inboxes` and `/engine/snapshot` when the inbox path is enabled
- publishes an operator-facing outbox descriptor through `/engine/outboxes` and `/engine/snapshot` when the outbox path is enabled, including the effective dispatch policy that currently owns or does not own staged-event execution
- projects that same inbox through the `event-driven-integration` technology surface as `inbox-stores` when the eventing technology is active
- projects that same outbox through the `event-driven-integration` technology surface as `outbox-producers` when the eventing technology is active
- enables an outbox-backed `IEventPublisher` handoff path when the eventing technology is active and a truthful staged-publication path is available

## How it fits

This pack sits on top of `Cephalon.Data`, not in place of it. `Cephalon.Data` still owns the runtime-neutral `IReadStore` / `IWriteStore` dispatching surface, while `Cephalon.Data.EntityFramework` supplies the first concrete relational baseline that query and command handlers can depend on through standard Entity Framework Core `DbContext` injection.

The current slice is intentionally honest and narrow: it proves optional `DbContext` registration, CQRS-style read/write role separation, runtime capability metadata, topology-aware resolution from `Engine:Databases`, startup schema apply through a generic-host hosted service for the registered `write` and optional `read` `DbContext` roles, an opt-in inbox persistence path where the write-side `DbContext` explicitly implements `IEntityFrameworkInboxContext` and maps the shared processed-message entity with `ConfigureCephalonInbox()`, an opt-in outbox persistence path where the same write-side `DbContext` can implement `IEntityFrameworkOutboxContext` and map the shared outbox entity with `ConfigureCephalonOutbox()`, operator-facing inbox and outbox descriptors that make staged-only idempotency and delivery truth visible through the runtime introspection surface, an `inbox-stores` technology surface entry that describes application-managed idempotency stores when `EventDrivenIntegration` is active, an `outbox-producers` technology surface entry under the same technology selection, subscription metadata that can now say an application-managed inbox store is available without pretending the eventing pack dispatches through it, a staged-only outbox-backed `IEventPublisher` handoff path, an adapter-neutral Entity Framework-backed `IEventDispatchStore` that can read pending staged rows and persist `dispatch_attempt_count`, `dispatched_at_utc`, and `next_attempt_at_utc` follow-through for later adapter-owned dispatch loops, and an outbox descriptor that now moves truthfully between `disabled`, `consumer-managed`, and runtime-managed dispatch ownership as eventing packs are added. The same baseline now also understands the engine-owned `UseRole` contract for dependent targets, so `Outbox` and `History` can explicitly reuse the concrete `write` connection while still layering local schema or runtime overrides. Full subscription execution, arbitrary role graphs, and richer projection pipelines are still later slices.

The current recommendation is still not to turn `DbContext` inheritance into the primary engine contract. That contract now lives one layer higher: the engine ships `Engine:Databases`, projects it into `AppProfile.Databases`, and exposes the raw topology through `/engine/databases`, the resolved runtime role catalog through `/engine/database-roles`, and the resolved migration target catalog through `/engine/database-migrations`. `Cephalon.Data.EntityFramework` now consumes the engine-owned `write` and `read` role shape directly, supplies the shared role-resolution and migration-registration primitives used by `Cephalon.Audit.EntityFramework`, surfaces requested versus resolved role metadata when `UseRole` is active, publishes live connectivity plus pending-migration diagnostics through the engine-owned role catalog, and now also projects stable physical-target identity plus co-location so hosts and operator tooling can see when named or inline connection reuse points multiple logical roles at one physical database. The pack also honors the engine-owned `RoleProbeFreshnessSeconds` contract so probes can be cached additively per logical role with `0` as the explicit no-cache answer, a 30-second provider default when the engine contract does not override it, and a typed `DatabaseRoleProbeDescriptor` answer on `DatabaseRoleRuntimeDescriptor.Probe` plus `DatabaseRoleDescriptor.Probe` for stable cache/freshness/source timing. The older `probeSource`, `probeFreshnessOrigin`, `probeFreshUntilUtc`, and `probeAgeSeconds` metadata keys remain for additive compatibility and provider-specific details, but hosts and samples should now prefer the typed probe contract instead of parsing stable `probe*` keys locally. The pack also publishes planned/running/succeeded/failed migration truth through the engine-owned migration catalog instead of keeping that state inside a hosted service only, mirrors resolved-role runtime truth onto each logical migration target through typed role-runtime fields instead of forcing hosts to read only metadata keys, adds typed recommended execution order hints so hosts and samples can reuse one provider-published migration sequence, adds operator-facing `dotnet ef` bundle/script/update templates plus typed tool/category/working-directory metadata so the production bundle/script-first guidance stays attached to each logical migration target without forcing consumers to parse metadata dictionaries for every known field, and supplies the physical-target grouping truth that lets the engine-owned migration playbook plus topology posture surface physical-target execution groups, grouped command paths, combined command batches, and coordinated shared-database warnings instead of leaving samples to infer that risk locally. Dedicated `outbox` execution, broader role-reference graphs, and real combined execution artifacts for shared-target migrations are still later follow-through, but the first truthful `history`-role execution path plus dependent role references are now shipped.
