`Cephalon.Observability.OpenShift` adds Red Hat OpenShift collector defaults for Cephalon hosts.

## What it owns

- host-builder registration for OTLP logs, metrics, and traces over the shared `Engine:Observability:Telemetry` contract when a shared collector endpoint or self-hosted OTLP path is already in place
- explicit OpenShift hosted defaults for cluster name, namespace, pod name, deployment environment, and `aro` / `rosa` cloud-provider stamping
- an opt-in in-cluster collector-service path for operator-managed OpenShift collectors when no shared endpoint is configured
- optional OTLP headers and optional HTTPS trusted-CA bundle handling for OTLP/HTTP traces and metrics
- startup diagnostics that summarize the active OpenShift export mode without logging secrets

## Main surfaces

- `Configuration/OpenShiftTelemetryExportOptions.cs`
- `Hosting/OpenShiftHostApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs`
- `Hosting/OpenShiftSummaryHostedService.cs`

## Source structure

- `Configuration`
- `Hosting`

## How it fits

This package stays outside `Cephalon.Engine` and `Cephalon.Observability` on purpose. The engine still owns diagnostics names and lifecycle signals, `Cephalon.Observability` still owns the shared telemetry contract, and this companion package layers OpenShift-specific collector discovery, trust material, and hosted resource defaults on top of that same OTLP baseline.

The OpenShift slice is intentionally explicit about its modes. If a host already has a shared OTLP collector, route, or gateway path, the package keeps using the shared `Endpoint` or `UseSelfHostedDefaults` flow and only adds OpenShift resource defaults such as cluster name, namespace, pod name, and deployment environment. If the host instead wants a cluster-local collector-service path, it can enable `Engine:Observability:Telemetry:OpenShift:UseInClusterCollectorService`, configure `CollectorServiceName`, and let the package build the in-cluster `svc.cluster.local` endpoint by using either the explicit collector namespace or the workload namespace.

HTTPS custom trust is also explicit. `TrustedCaCertificatePath` is meant for projected OpenShift service CAs or other cluster-local trust bundles, and the current implementation only applies that custom trust path to OTLP/HTTP traces and metrics. Because the current OpenTelemetry logging exporter does not support custom `HttpClientFactory` wiring for HTTP, the package rejects configurations that would require that same custom CA bundle for logs instead of pretending they are supported.
