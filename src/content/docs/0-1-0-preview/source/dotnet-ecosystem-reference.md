title: .NET Ecosystem Reference for CephalonEngine
editUrl: false
---

> Comprehensive reference of .NET libraries, frameworks, and NuGet packages relevant to building CephalonEngine -- a modular-monolith engine framework on .NET 10. Researched April 2026.

---

## 1. Hosting, Configuration, and Dependency Injection

### Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting (Generic Host / WebApplication)

**What it does:** Provides the Generic Host (`IHost`) and `WebApplicationBuilder`/`WebApplication` bootstrapping for .NET applications. The host encapsulates DI, configuration, logging, and hosted services into a single object that manages application lifetime.

**Key features:**
- `WebApplicationBuilder` (ASP.NET) and `HostApplicationBuilder` (non-HTTP) unify startup
- Automatic integration with `IConfiguration`, `ILogger`, and `IServiceProvider`
- `IHostedService` / `BackgroundService` lifecycle management
- `IHostEnvironment` for environment-aware behavior

**Framework relevance to CephalonEngine:** The engine's composition runtime (`Cephalon.Engine`) already relies on `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions`. The Generic Host is the natural entry point for all Cephalon host types (ASP.NET, Worker, Edge).

**Current version:** Ships with .NET 10 (10.0.x). LTS release.

---

### Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration

**What it does:** Layered configuration system with multiple providers (JSON, environment variables, user secrets, Azure Key Vault, command line).

**Key features:**
- Provider chain with override semantics (last writer wins)
- `IConfiguration` / `IConfigurationSection` for hierarchical reads
- Binding to POCOs via `ConfigurationBinder` or Options pattern
- Hot-reload support (`reloadOnChange: true` for JSON files)

**Framework relevance:** `Cephalon.Behaviors` already references `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder`. All module-level configuration flows through this stack.

**Current version:** 10.0.x (ships in-box with .NET 10).

---

### Microsoft.Extensions.Options (IOptions / IOptionsSnapshot / IOptionsMonitor)

**What it does:** Strongly-typed access to configuration sections with validation and change-notification support.

**Key features and differences:**
- **`IOptions<T>`** -- Singleton. Read once at startup. Does NOT support named options or reload.
- **`IOptionsSnapshot<T>`** -- Scoped. Re-reads on each scope (each HTTP request). Supports named options via `.Get("name")`.
- **`IOptionsMonitor<T>`** -- Singleton but observes changes. Fires `OnChange` callback. Supports named options.
- **Validation:** `.ValidateDataAnnotations()`, `.Validate(Func)`, `.ValidateOnStart()` -- ensures fail-fast on misconfiguration.
- **Modern .NET 10 pattern:** `services.AddOptions<T>().BindConfiguration("Section").ValidateDataAnnotations().ValidateOnStart()`

**Framework relevance:** `Cephalon.Behaviors` already references `Microsoft.Extensions.Options`. Every Cephalon module should use the Options pattern for its configuration section, and the engine should enforce `ValidateOnStart()` so misconfigurations surface at boot time rather than at runtime.

**Current version:** 10.0.x (in-box).

---

### Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection (Built-in DI)

**What it does:** The default IoC container for all .NET applications since .NET Core. Lightweight, fast, and the de-facto standard.

**Key features:**
- Transient, Scoped, Singleton lifetimes
- Open-generic registrations (`services.AddSingleton(typeof(IRepo<>), typeof(Repo<>))`)
- **Keyed services** (.NET 8+): `services.AddKeyedSingleton<ICache>("redis", ...)` -- resolve via `[FromKeyedServices("redis")]`
- Factory-based registrations
- `IServiceProviderIsService` for feature detection

**Limitations vs third-party containers:**
- No property injection
- No child/nested lifetime scopes beyond the built-in request scope
- No AOP / interception / decoration (need Scrutor or manual registration)
- No assembly scanning (need Scrutor)
- No conditional registrations

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine uses `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions` throughout. Keyed services are particularly relevant for multi-provider scenarios (e.g., keying different event-store backends by tenant or purpose).

**Current version:** 10.0.x (in-box). LTS.

---

### Autofac (Third-party DI)

**What it does:** Full-featured IoC container with advanced capabilities beyond the built-in container.

**Key features unique to Autofac:**
- **Property injection** -- automatically resolves required properties (Autofac 7.0+)
- **Modules** (`IModule`) -- modular, composable registration units
- **Child lifetime scopes** -- create nested scopes with specific registrations (e.g., per-unit-of-work)
- **Keyed/Named services** (predates .NET 8 keyed services)
- **Interception** via `Autofac.Extras.DynamicProxy` (Castle DynamicProxy)
- **Decorator support** built-in
- **Assembly scanning** with rich filtering

**When to use over built-in:** When you need property injection, child scopes, AOP/interception, or module-based registration composition across a large solution.

**Performance note:** The built-in container is approximately 5x faster than Autofac for simple resolve operations. Use Autofac only when its advanced features are required.

**Current version:** Autofac 9.0.0; `Autofac.Extensions.DependencyInjection` integrates with the Generic Host.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine could optionally support Autofac for users who need child scopes or interception. The engine's `ICephalonModule` registration could be implemented as an Autofac `Module` for those scenarios.

---

### Lamar (Third-party DI by JasperFx)

**What it does:** Fast IoC container and StructureMap successor, optimized for ASP.NET Core. Part of the JasperFx "Critter Stack."

**Key features:**
- **Roslyn-based code generation** for dependency resolution (no Expression trees or IL emit)
- **Diagnostic tools** -- `WhatDoIHave()`, `WhatDidIScan()`, environment checks
- **Assembly scanning** with convention-based registration
- **Decorator / interceptor support**
- **Inline dependencies** and constructor selection policies

**When to use over built-in:** When you want Wolverine/Marten integration (Critter Stack uses Lamar internally), need advanced diagnostics, or are migrating from StructureMap.

**Current version:** Lamar 15.0.1. Actively maintained by JasperFx.

**Framework relevance:** Since CephalonEngine already integrates with Wolverine (`Cephalon.Eventing.Wolverine`), Lamar is a natural fit for users on the Critter Stack path.

---

## 2. Messaging and CQRS Frameworks

### MediatR

**What it does:** In-process mediator pattern implementation for .NET. Decouples request/command senders from handlers.

**Key features:**
- **`IRequest<TResponse>` / `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`** -- request/response pattern
- **`INotification` / `INotificationHandler`** -- pub/sub for in-process events
- **`IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>`** -- cross-cutting middleware (logging, validation, transactions, caching)
- **Stream requests** (MediatR 10.0+) -- `IStreamRequest<TResponse>` returns `IAsyncEnumerable`
- Pipeline behaviors are ordered and composable

**When to use:** Best for in-process CQRS where you want handler isolation and a clean pipeline. Lightweight; no transport or durability.

**When to avoid:** When you need durable messaging, distributed pub/sub, or saga orchestration -- use Wolverine or MassTransit instead.

**Current version:** MediatR 12.x. Supports .NET 8+.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine's behavior pipeline (`Cephalon.Behaviors`) is conceptually similar to MediatR pipeline behaviors. The engine could offer a MediatR-compatible adapter or serve as an alternative.

---

### Wolverine (JasperFx -- Critter Stack)

**What it does:** Next-generation .NET mediator + message bus + saga engine. Combines CQRS command handling, asynchronous messaging, scheduled jobs, and durable inbox/outbox in one framework.

**Key features:**
- **In-process command handling** (MediatR alternative with less ceremony)
- **Durable inbox/outbox** with Marten (PostgreSQL) or Polecat (SQL Server)
- **Transports:** RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Amazon SQS, Kafka, TCP
- **Saga/workflow orchestration** built-in
- **HTTP endpoint generation** from message handlers
- **Aggregate handler workflow** for event-sourced aggregates
- **Code generation** via Roslyn (no reflection at runtime)
- **Polecat integration** (NEW, March 2026) -- SQL Server-backed event sourcing

**When to use over MediatR:** When you need durability, distributed messaging, saga orchestration, or the Critter Stack's event-sourcing integration.

**Current version:** Actively developed. Latest releases in March/April 2026. Fully supports .NET 10.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine already has `Cephalon.Eventing.Wolverine` which references `WolverineFx`. Wolverine is a first-class integration target. Polecat expands this to SQL Server users.

---

### MassTransit

**What it does:** Distributed application framework for .NET. Provides a message bus abstraction over RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Amazon SQS, Kafka, and more.

**Key features:**
- **Consumer/Handler model** with strongly-typed messages
- **Saga orchestration** (state machine sagas and routing slips)
- **Transports:** RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, SQS, Kafka, gRPC, In-Memory
- **Middleware/filters** pipeline
- **Automatic topology configuration** (queues, exchanges)
- **Outbox pattern** support
- **Scheduling** via Quartz.NET or Hangfire integration
- **Multicast, versioning, encryption, retries, transactions**

**IMPORTANT licensing change:** MassTransit v9 (announced April 2025) transitions to **commercial licensing**. v8 remains Apache 2.0 and will receive security patches through at least end of 2026. **OpenTransit** is a community-driven open-source fork of v8 targeting .NET 10+.

**When to use:** Enterprise distributed messaging with complex topologies, saga state machines, and multi-transport support. When you need transport abstraction across RabbitMQ/Azure/AWS.

**Current version:** v8.x (OSS, Apache 2.0); v9.x (commercial).

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine could provide a MassTransit transport adapter for its eventing layer, though the licensing change means OpenTransit or Wolverine may be more appropriate defaults.

---

### NServiceBus

**What it does:** Enterprise-grade service bus for .NET with world-class tooling.

**Key features:**
- **Sagas, retries, recoverability** with advanced error handling
- **ServicePulse** (monitoring dashboard), **ServiceInsight** (message flow visualization), **ServiceControl** (the nervous system)
- **Transports:** RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Amazon SQS, SQL Server, MSMQ, Learning
- **Outbox, delayed delivery, scheduling**
- **Long-running process management**

**Licensing:** Commercial license (per endpoint). Free for development/evaluation.

**When to use:** Large-scale enterprise systems where the tooling (ServicePulse, ServiceInsight) and support contract justify the cost.

**Current version:** NServiceBus 9.x. Supports .NET 8+.

---

### Brighter

**What it does:** Command Processor pattern implementation following the Ports & Adapters architecture.

**Key features:**
- **Command Processor** with handler pipeline (pre/post decorators)
- **Task Queue** for async dispatch
- **Outbox pattern** for reliable messaging
- Supports RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SNS/SQS, Azure Service Bus, Redis

**When to use:** When you want clean Ports & Adapters architecture with explicit pipeline decoration. Good for teams familiar with CQRS patterns from the Go4 Command pattern.

**Current version:** Actively maintained. Compatible with .NET 8+.

---

### Rebus

**What it does:** Lean, simple .NET service bus following "smart endpoints, dumb pipes."

**Key features:**
- **Extremely simple API** -- minimal ceremony
- **Transports:** RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Amazon SQS, SQL Server, In-Memory, File System
- **Sagas, retries, timeouts, routing**
- **Free and open-source** (MIT license) -- will stay that way forever

**When to use:** Small to medium applications where simplicity is prioritized. When you want a messaging bus without the complexity of MassTransit or NServiceBus.

**Current version:** Rebus 10.x. Actively maintained.

---

## 3. Event Sourcing and Projections

### Marten (JasperFx -- Critter Stack)

**What it does:** .NET document database AND event store built on PostgreSQL. Uses PostgreSQL's native JSON support.

**Key features:**
- **Document Store:** LINQ-queryable document DB with ACID transactions
- **Event Store:** Full event sourcing with stream append, projections, subscriptions
- **Projection types:**
  - **Inline** -- run in same transaction as event append (strong consistency)
  - **Async** -- background processing via the Projection Daemon (eventual consistency)
  - **Live/Catch-up subscriptions** for real-time event consumption
  - **Flat Table Projections** -- project events into relational tables
- **Snapshotting** for long event streams
- **Multi-tenancy** (conjoined tenancy, database-per-tenant)
- **Event versioning and upcasting**

**When to use:** When using PostgreSQL and you want combined document DB + event store without a separate database. Excellent Wolverine integration.

**Current version:** Actively maintained (GitHub updated February 2026). Requires PostgreSQL 12+.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine has multiple event-sourcing providers. Marten would be the PostgreSQL provider, potentially replacing or complementing `Cephalon.EventSourcing.EntityFramework` for PostgreSQL users.

---

### Polecat (JasperFx -- Critter Stack) -- NEW 2026

**What it does:** SQL Server-backed event store and document database. Port of Marten targeting SQL Server 2025's JSON data type.

**Key features:**
- **Event Store** with projections, subscriptions, snapshots, async daemon
- **Document Database** with LINQ querying
- **Dynamic Consistency Boundaries**
- **Multi-tenancy** (conjoined tenancy, database-per-tenant)
- **Wolverine integration** for HTTP and CQRS

**When to use:** When your organization mandates SQL Server and you want Marten-equivalent event sourcing.

**Current version:** 1.0 (released March 2026). Fully supported by JasperFx Software.

**Framework relevance:** Polecat fills the SQL Server gap in the Critter Stack. CephalonEngine could add a `Cephalon.EventSourcing.Polecat` provider.

---

### EventStoreDB (Kurrent)

**What it does:** Purpose-built, dedicated event database designed for event streams at scale.

**Key features:**
- **Immutable append-only streams** -- events are never overwritten
- **Push-based subscriptions** (catch-up, persistent, filtered)
- **Server-side projections** (JavaScript)
- **gRPC client API** (`EventStore.Client.Grpc.Streams`)
- **Cluster mode** for high availability
- **OpenTelemetry integration** via `EventStore.Client.Extensions.OpenTelemetry`

**When to use:** When event sourcing is your primary architectural pattern and you want a dedicated, optimized event database rather than a general-purpose DB.

**Current version:** EventStore.Client.Grpc 23.3.9. (DB is now branded as "Kurrent").

---

### Eventuous

**What it does:** Lightweight, production-grade event sourcing library for .NET implementing DDD tactical patterns.

**Key features:**
- **Aggregates** with state folding, strongly-typed identities, optimistic concurrency
- **Command services, subscriptions, projections**
- **First-class backends:** KurrentDB (EventStoreDB), PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite
- **Common abstraction layer** across backends

**When to use:** When you want a lightweight event sourcing framework that is less opinionated than Marten but more structured than rolling your own.

**Note:** API is not yet fully stable -- changes may occur between versions.

**Current version:** Available on NuGet. Active development. NDC Oslo 2026 session scheduled.

---

### Projection Patterns Summary

| Pattern | Consistency | Latency | Use Case |
|---------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Inline** | Strong (same transaction) | Zero | Read models that must be immediately consistent |
| **Async (Daemon)** | Eventual | Milliseconds to seconds | Dashboards, search indices, denormalized views |
| **Catch-up Subscription** | Eventual (replay) | Depends on gap | Rebuilding projections, new consumers |
| **Flat Table** | Depends on lifecycle | Varies | Reporting tables, analytics |

---

## 4. ORM and Data Access

### Entity Framework Core 10

**What it does:** The primary ORM for .NET. Full LINQ-to-SQL translation, change tracking, migrations, and now NativeAOT support.

**Key new features in EF Core 10:**
- **Vector search** -- `SqlVector<float>` type + `VECTOR_DISTANCE()` for AI/RAG workloads (SQL Server 2025 / Azure SQL)
- **JSON type support** -- native SQL Server JSON data type + `ExecuteUpdateAsync` on JSON columns
- **LeftJoin / RightJoin** -- first-class LINQ operators (new in .NET 10)
- **Improved parameterized collections** -- `IN` clauses use individual parameters with padding for plan cache efficiency
- **ExecuteUpdateAsync lambda** -- now accepts plain `Action` instead of requiring expression trees
- **Precompiled queries** (experimental) -- NativeAOT support with compile-time SQL generation via interceptors
- **OpenAPI 3.1** schema generation improvements
- **Split query consistency** fixes

**Interceptors:**
- `ISaveChangesInterceptor` -- intercept/modify SaveChanges operations
- `IDbCommandInterceptor` -- intercept raw SQL commands
- `IDbConnectionInterceptor` -- intercept connection open/close
- Use cases: audit trails, soft deletes, multi-tenancy query filters, read/write splitting

**Compiled Models:** Pre-generate model and mappings at build time; cuts startup overhead by 60-80%.

**Current version:** EF Core 10.0.x (LTS, supported through November 2028).

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine has `Cephalon.Data.EntityFramework` and `Cephalon.EventSourcing.EntityFramework`. Both reference `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`. The engine should consider exposing interceptor registration APIs and compiled-model integration.

---

### Dapper

**What it does:** Micro-ORM developed by Stack Overflow. Thin layer over ADO.NET that maps query results to objects.

**Key features:**
- Raw SQL with parameterized queries
- Multi-mapping (one-to-many joins)
- Stored procedure support
- Dynamic return types
- Minimal overhead -- ~1.5-2x faster than EF Core for simple queries

**When to use vs EF Core:**
- **Use Dapper** for read-heavy hot paths, complex hand-tuned SQL, reporting queries
- **Use EF Core** for writes with change tracking, migrations, complex object graphs
- **Hybrid approach** (EF for writes, Dapper for reads) is common in high-performance systems

**Performance (2025 benchmarks):** EF Core 9+ with compiled queries is within 1.5-2x of Dapper for most read scenarios. Dapper still wins for raw single-record operations (~169us vs ~209us).

**Current version:** Dapper 2.x. Widely used.

---

### Marten (as Document Store)

See Section 3 above. Marten doubles as a document database on PostgreSQL with LINQ querying, making it an alternative to MongoDB for teams already on PostgreSQL.

---

### MongoDB .NET Driver

**What it does:** Official C#/.NET driver for MongoDB.

**Key features:**
- LINQ provider for type-safe queries
- Aggregation pipeline builder
- Change streams for real-time notifications
- GridFS for large file storage
- **Vector search index support** (v3.6) -- `CreateVectorSearchIndexModel` and auto-embedding

**Current version:** MongoDB.Driver 3.6.0 (March 2026).

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine has `Cephalon.Data.MongoDB` and `Cephalon.EventSourcing.MongoDB`.

---

### StackExchange.Redis

**What it does:** High-performance .NET client for Redis, Garnet, Valkey, AWS ElastiCache, and Azure Managed Redis.

**Key features:**
- Multiplexed connection model (single connection, concurrent commands)
- Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, transactions, pipelining
- Sentinel and Cluster mode support
- `ConfigurationOptions` for fine-grained connection tuning

**Current version:** StackExchange.Redis 2.11.8.

**Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis:** Provides `IDistributedCache` implementation backed by Redis. Current version 9.0.10. Bridges Redis into the standard .NET caching abstraction.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine has `Cephalon.Data.Redis`. The engine should ensure the Redis provider supports both raw StackExchange.Redis operations and the `IDistributedCache` abstraction.

---

## 5. HTTP and API

### ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs (.NET 10)

**What it does:** Lightweight HTTP endpoint routing without controllers. The recommended approach for new APIs.

**Key .NET 10 features:**
- **Built-in validation** -- `builder.Services.AddValidation()` with DataAnnotations on query, header, and body parameters
- **Record type validation** support
- **Server-Sent Events** -- `TypedResults.ServerSentEvents` for streaming
- **OpenAPI 3.1** with JSON Schema draft 2020-12
- **XML doc comment** integration into OpenAPI via source generator
- **`IOpenApiDocumentProvider`** in DI for programmatic OpenAPI access
- **`IProblemDetailsService`** customization for validation errors
- **YAML OpenAPI** document support
- **Endpoint-specific OpenAPI operation transformers**

**Framework relevance:** `Cephalon.AspNetCore` already references `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`. The engine's HTTP layer should leverage the new validation and SSE features.

---

### Carter

**What it does:** Module pattern for organizing Minimal APIs. Provides `ICarterModule` as an organizational unit.

**Key features:**
- `ICarterModule` interface for grouping related endpoints
- Automatic module discovery via assembly scanning
- FluentValidation integration
- Model binding helpers

**When to use:** When you want module-based organization of Minimal APIs without the full MVC controller overhead. Good for modular monoliths where each module exposes its own routes.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine's module system (`ICephalonModule`) serves a similar purpose. Carter's approach could inspire the engine's HTTP endpoint registration patterns.

---

### FastEndpoints

**What it does:** Implementation of the REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response) design pattern for ASP.NET Core.

**Key features:**
- One class per endpoint (no controllers)
- Built-in request validation (FluentValidation integration)
- Pre/Post processor pipeline
- Command bus for in-process messaging
- Swagger/OpenAPI support
- JWT and cookie authentication helpers

**When to use:** When you want the structure of the REPR pattern with high performance. Good alternative to MVC controllers that provides strong endpoint isolation.

**Current version:** FastEndpoints 5.x. Very active development.

---

### Refit

**What it does:** Automatic type-safe REST client generation from interface definitions.

**Key features:**
- Define interfaces with HTTP attributes (`[Get]`, `[Post]`, etc.)
- **Source generator** (Refit 9.0+) -- compile-time client generation, no runtime reflection
- **AOT and trimming support** for .NET 10+
- Integrates with `HttpClientFactory`
- Supports multipart, form data, streaming

**When to use:** For typed HTTP client calls to external APIs. Eliminates boilerplate `HttpClient` code.

**Current version:** Refit 9.0.2 (November 2025). AOT-compatible.

---

### gRPC (.NET)

**What it does:** High-performance RPC framework using Protocol Buffers for service definition and binary serialization.

**Key features:**
- **Code generation** from `.proto` files
- **Bidirectional streaming** (unary, server-streaming, client-streaming, bidirectional)
- **`Grpc.Net.ClientFactory`** -- integrates with DI and `HttpClientFactory`
- **gRPC-Web** support for browser clients
- **Deadline/cancellation** propagation
- **Interceptors** for cross-cutting concerns

**Current version:** Grpc.Net.Client 2.76.0; Grpc.Net.ClientFactory 2.76.0.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine has `Cephalon.AspNetCore.Grpc`. The test project already references `Grpc.Net.Client`.

---

### HotChocolate (GraphQL)

**What it does:** Open-source GraphQL server for .NET. Compliant with GraphQL October 2021 spec + drafts.

**Key features:**
- **Schema-first and code-first** approaches
- **Filtering, sorting, projections, pagination** as middleware attributes
- **DataLoader** for batching and caching
- **Subscriptions** (WebSocket, SSE)
- **Federation** (Fusion) for distributed data graphs
- **Nitro IDE** middleware
- **Stand-alone, serverless (Azure Function / AWS Lambda), and gateway** deployment

**Current version:** HotChocolate 15.1.13 (April 2026). V16 documentation is available.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine has `Cephalon.AspNetCore.GraphQL`.

---

### SignalR

**What it does:** Real-time bidirectional communication over WebSockets (with SSE and Long Polling fallbacks).

**Key features:**
- **Hub-based** programming model
- **Groups** and **user-based** message targeting
- **Streaming** (server-to-client and client-to-server)
- **MessagePack** binary protocol option (in addition to JSON)
- **Automatic reconnection** and connection management
- **Azure SignalR Service** for scaling

**Use cases:** Dashboards, live notifications, collaborative editing, gaming, chat, GPS tracking.

**Current version:** Ships in-box with ASP.NET Core 10.

---

## 6. Serialization

### System.Text.Json

**What it does:** The built-in, high-performance JSON serializer for .NET.

**Key features:**
- **Source generators** (`JsonSerializerContext`) -- compile-time serialization for AOT/trimming/startup performance
- **Polymorphism** -- `[JsonDerivedType]` attribute with type discriminators (JSON, not source-gen fast path)
- **Custom converters** -- `JsonConverter<T>` (basic) and `JsonConverterFactory` (open-generic/enum)
- **Number handling** -- `AllowReadingFromString` (default in ASP.NET Core)
- **Streaming** -- `JsonSerializer.SerializeAsync` / `DeserializeAsync` with `Stream`
- **DOM** -- `JsonNode`, `JsonObject`, `JsonArray` for schema-less manipulation

**Limitations with source generators:**
- Polymorphism is supported in metadata-based source gen but NOT fast-path source gen
- Custom converters and type discrimination are not fully combinable with source generators

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine should standardize on `System.Text.Json` with source generators for its serialization layer. Custom converters are needed for domain types (e.g., strongly-typed IDs, discriminated unions).

---

### MessagePack for C#

**What it does:** Extremely fast binary serializer for .NET. 10x faster than MsgPack-Cli.

**Key features:**
- Zero-allocation serialization paths
- **LZ4 compression** built-in
- Full C# type system support (including nulls, unlike Protobuf)
- **Source generator** (`MessagePackAnalyzer`) for compile-time code generation
- Union types (discriminated unions)
- Contractless mode (no attributes required)

**When to use:** Inter-service communication where performance matters more than human readability. Event store payload serialization. SignalR binary protocol.

**Current version:** MessagePack-CSharp 3.x. Actively maintained.

---

### protobuf-net

**What it does:** Protocol Buffers implementation for .NET without requiring `.proto` files.

**Key features:**
- Attribute-based mapping (`[ProtoContract]`, `[ProtoMember]`)
- Compatible with Google's protobuf wire format
- Inheritance support
- Code-first approach (no `.proto` file needed)

**Limitations:**
- No null representation (protobuf limitation)
- Empty collections treated as null
- Slightly larger message sizes than MessagePack due to field tags

**When to use:** When interoperating with non-.NET systems that use Protocol Buffers, or when you want the protobuf wire format without maintaining `.proto` files.

**Current version:** protobuf-net 3.x.

---

## 7. Resilience and HTTP

### Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience + Polly v8

**What it does:** Official resilience layer for `HttpClient` in .NET, built on top of Polly v8.

**Key features:**
- **Resilience strategies:** Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Rate Limiter, Fallback, Hedging
- **`AddStandardResilienceHandler()`** -- stacks multiple strategies with sensible defaults
- **`AddStandardHedgingHandler()`** -- sends parallel requests to reduce tail latency
- **Built-in telemetry** with OpenTelemetry
- **Fluent pipeline builder** API from Polly v8

**Polly v8 (standalone) strategies:**
- `RetryStrategyOptions` -- configurable retries with jitter
- `CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions` -- half-open/open/closed states
- `TimeoutStrategyOptions` -- per-request and overall timeouts
- `BulkheadStrategyOptions` -- concurrency limiting (renamed to `ConcurrencyLimiter` in v8)
- `FallbackStrategyOptions` -- graceful degradation
- `HedgingStrategyOptions` -- speculative execution

**Migration note:** `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly` is **deprecated**. Use `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience` instead.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine should provide built-in resilience configuration for its HTTP client registrations, using the standard resilience handler by default.

---

### HttpClientFactory Patterns

**Key patterns:**
- **Named clients** -- `services.AddHttpClient("github", ...)` with per-client configuration
- **Typed clients** -- `services.AddHttpClient<GitHubClient>()` for DI-friendly typed access
- **Refit integration** -- `services.AddRefitClient<IGitHubApi>()` for code-gen clients
- **Message handlers** -- `DelegatingHandler` pipeline for auth, logging, correlation
- **Resilience** -- chain `.AddStandardResilienceHandler()` onto any client registration

---

## 8. Background Processing

### IHostedService / BackgroundService

**What it does:** Built-in .NET abstraction for background tasks that run alongside the application host.

**Key features:**
- `BackgroundService` base class with `ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken)` override
- Automatic lifecycle management (start/stop with host)
- Graceful shutdown via cancellation token
- Multiple services run concurrently

**When to use:** Simple background loops, queue consumers, periodic tasks. No persistence or scheduling.

---

### System.Threading.Channels

**What it does:** Thread-safe, async-native producer/consumer data structures.

**Key features:**
- **`Channel.CreateBounded<T>(capacity)`** -- backpressure when full
- **`Channel.CreateUnbounded<T>()`** -- unbounded, fastest path
- **`ChannelReader<T>`** / **`ChannelWriter<T>`** -- separate read/write concerns
- Supports `IAsyncEnumerable` consumption
- Zero-allocation for many patterns

**When to use:** Decoupling fast HTTP request paths from slow background processing. In-process message queues. Signal/event buffering.

**Framework relevance:** Channels are the ideal primitive for CephalonEngine's internal event dispatching -- buffer events from the command side and consume them in background processors.

---

### Hangfire

**What it does:** Persistent background job framework with dashboard, retries, and scheduling.

**Key features:**
- **Fire-and-forget jobs** -- `BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => DoWork())`
- **Delayed jobs** -- schedule for future execution
- **Recurring jobs** -- cron-based scheduling
- **Continuations** -- chain jobs
- **Dashboard** for monitoring and management
- **Storage backends:** SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB

**When to use:** Web applications needing persistent job scheduling with a UI dashboard. Email sending, report generation, data synchronization.

**Current version:** Hangfire 1.8.x (updated February 2026).

---

### Quartz.NET

**What it does:** Enterprise-grade job scheduling library. Port of Java's Quartz.

**Key features:**
- **Cron expressions** with timezone awareness
- **Job clustering** -- multiple nodes, single executor
- **Calendar exclusions** (holidays, blackout periods)
- **Misfire handling** policies
- **Persistent job store** (SQL Server, PostgreSQL)
- **Listener model** for job/trigger/scheduler events

**When to use:** Complex scheduling requirements -- timezone-aware cron, holiday exclusions, clustered execution, job overlap prevention.

**Current version:** Quartz.NET 3.x.

---

## 9. Validation

### FluentValidation

**What it does:** Strongly-typed validation rules using a fluent API.

**Key features:**
- `AbstractValidator<T>` with chainable rule builders
- Complex rules: `Must()`, `When()`, `Unless()`, `SetValidator()` for nested objects
- **Async validation** support
- **DI integration** via `FluentValidation.DependencyInjectionExtensions`
- Custom validators and property validators

**IMPORTANT:** `FluentValidation.AspNetCore` is **deprecated**. Use endpoint filters (Minimal APIs) or manual validation instead of the auto-validation pipeline.

**Current version:** FluentValidation 12.1.1. Supports .NET 8+.

---

### DataAnnotations

**What it does:** Attribute-based validation using `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`.

**Key features:**
- `[Required]`, `[Range]`, `[StringLength]`, `[RegularExpression]`, `[EmailAddress]`
- `[CustomValidation]` for complex rules
- `IValidatableObject` interface for model-level validation
- Supported by EF Core, ASP.NET MVC, Blazor, and now Minimal APIs

---

### Microsoft.Extensions.Validation (.NET 10) -- NEW

**What it does:** New framework validation package that extracts validation logic from ASP.NET Core into a standalone package.

**Key features:**
- **`builder.Services.AddValidation()`** -- registers validation services
- Automatic endpoint filter for Minimal APIs
- Validates query strings, headers, route parameters, and request body
- Uses DataAnnotations (`[Required]`, `[Range]`, etc.) and `IValidatableObject`
- **Record type** support
- **`IProblemDetailsService`** integration for custom error responses
- **`DisableValidation()`** per-endpoint opt-out
- Usable **outside** ASP.NET Core HTTP scenarios

**Experimental features:** `[ValidatableType]` and `[SkipValidation]` attributes are marked experimental in .NET 10.

**Current version:** Microsoft.Extensions.Validation 10.0.x.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine should integrate with `Microsoft.Extensions.Validation` for its behavior pipeline validation, allowing module authors to use DataAnnotations on command/query types that get validated before handler execution.

---

## 10. Testing

### xUnit.net v3

**What it does:** The most popular .NET test framework. v3 is a major rewrite.

**Key v3 features:**
- **`AssemblyFixtureAttribute`** -- assembly-wide fixtures (created before any test, disposed after all)
- **`TestContext`** -- pipeline state + cancellation token for downstream methods
- **Query filter language** (`-filter`) for complex test filtering
- **Immutable collection assertions** (`System.Collections.Immutable` support)
- **Failure cause tracking** (Assertion, Timeout, Exception)
- **NativeAOT-compatible** assertion library (`xunit.v3.assert.aot`)
- **`dotnet test` integration** with Microsoft Testing Platform (MTP v2)
- New templates: `dotnet new xunit3`

**Current version:** xunit.v3 3.2.2 (January 2026).

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine's test projects already use xUnit. Upgrade path to v3 should be planned.

---

### NUnit

**What it does:** Alternative test framework with a rich assertion model and attribute-based test configuration.

**Key features:**
- `Assert.That(...)` constraint-based assertions
- `[TestCase]`, `[TestCaseSource]` for parameterized tests
- `[SetUp]`, `[TearDown]`, `[OneTimeSetUp]`, `[OneTimeTearDown]`
- Parallel test execution

---

### Mocking: Moq vs NSubstitute vs FakeItEasy

| Feature | Moq | NSubstitute | FakeItEasy |
|---------|-----|-------------|------------|
| Market share | ~70% | ~25% | ~15% |
| Syntax style | Lambda-based `.Setup()` | Direct method calls (cleanest) | `A.CallTo(...)` |
| `.Object` needed | Yes | No | No |
| Async support | `.ReturnsAsync()` | `.Returns()` (handles both) | `.Returns()` |
| Controversy | SponsorLink bundling | None | None |

**Recommendation for new projects:** NSubstitute (cleanest syntax, no controversy) or FakeItEasy (simplest API).

---

### TestContainers

**What it does:** Manages Docker containers for integration tests -- databases, message brokers, etc.

**Key features:**
- Pre-built modules: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Elasticsearch
- Automatic container lifecycle (create, start, stop, remove)
- xUnit v3 integration (`Testcontainers.XunitV3`)
- Random port mapping for parallel test execution
- Resource reaper for cleanup

**Current version:** Testcontainers.NET (latest). .NET Standard 2.0+.

**Current version:** Latest Verify package. Active development.

---

### Bogus

**What it does:** Fake data generator for .NET. Port of faker.js.

**Key features:**
- `Faker<T>` for generating typed fake objects
- Locale support (names, addresses by country)
- Deterministic generation via seed
- Rich API: `f.Name.FullName()`, `f.Internet.Email()`, `f.Commerce.Price()`

---

### Respawn

**What it does:** Intelligent database reset for integration tests.

**Key features:**
- Deletes data from tables in correct foreign-key order
- Much faster than dropping/recreating databases
- Checkpoint model: configure once, reset repeatedly
- Supports SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL

---

### Alba

**What it does:** Integration testing helper for ASP.NET Core. Wraps `TestServer` with a declarative API.

**Key features:**
- Declarative scenario syntax for HTTP assertions
- Works with both `Startup.cs` and `WebApplicationBuilder` patterns
- Response body assertions, header checks, status code validation
- Integrates with Wolverine for testing message-driven endpoints

**Current version:** Alba 8.5.2. Supports .NET 8+.

---

### WebApplicationFactory

**What it does:** Built-in ASP.NET Core test host for integration testing.

**Key features:**
- Creates in-memory `TestServer`
- Override services, configuration, and logging for tests
- `HttpClient` creation for end-to-end HTTP testing
- `WithWebHostBuilder()` for per-test customization

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine tests already use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost`. Alba provides a nicer API on top of `WebApplicationFactory`.

---

## 11. Observability

### OpenTelemetry .NET

**What it does:** Vendor-neutral observability framework for traces, metrics, and logs.

**.NET implementation architecture:** Unlike other platforms, .NET provides native APIs that OpenTelemetry builds on:
- **Traces:** `System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource` (= OTel Tracer) + `Activity` (= OTel Span)
- **Metrics:** `System.Diagnostics.Metrics.Meter` (= OTel Meter)
- **Logs:** `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger` (= OTel Logger)

**Key packages:**
- `OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting` -- host integration
- `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol` -- OTLP export
- `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` -- automatic HTTP tracing
- `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` -- HttpClient tracing (optional on .NET 9+)

**.NET 10 additions:**
- **Telemetry schema URLs** on `ActivitySource` and `Meter`
- **Out-of-proc trace support** for Activity events and links
- **Rate-limit trace-sampling** support
- New `ActivitySourceOptions` for simplified construction

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine has `Cephalon.Observability.OpenTelemetry` which already references the key OTel packages. The engine should emit activities from its behavior pipeline, event sourcing operations, and module lifecycle events.

---

### Serilog

**What it does:** Structured logging library for .NET. 2.5B+ NuGet downloads.

**Key features:**
- **Structured events** -- key-value pairs, not just string messages
- **Sinks:** Console, File, Seq, Elasticsearch, Application Insights, Datadog, and 100+ more
- **Enrichers:** Add context properties (machine name, thread ID, correlation ID)
- **`Serilog.Extensions.Hosting`** -- integrates with Generic Host
- **`Serilog.Settings.Configuration`** -- configure from `appsettings.json`
- **Message templates** with destructuring (`{@Object}`, `{$Type}`)

**Current version:** Serilog 4.x. `Serilog.Extensions.Hosting` 9.x.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine has `Cephalon.Observability.Serilog` which references `Serilog.Extensions.Hosting` and `Serilog.Settings.Configuration`.

---

### Seq

**What it does:** Structured log aggregation and analysis server. First-class Serilog integration.

**Key features:**
- Real-time log streaming with structured queries
- Dashboards and alerts
- API key-based authentication for clients
- Self-hosted or Seq Cloud
- CLEF (Compact Log Event Format) support

---

### System.Diagnostics Primitives

| Type | OTel Equivalent | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| `ActivitySource` | Tracer | Creates spans/activities |
| `Activity` | Span | Represents a unit of work |
| `Meter` | Meter | Creates metric instruments |
| `Counter<T>` | Counter | Monotonically increasing value |
| `Histogram<T>` | Histogram | Distribution of values |
| `UpDownCounter<T>` | UpDownCounter | Value that can increase or decrease |
| `DiagnosticSource` | N/A | Rich payload event source (legacy, use ActivitySource) |
| `ActivityListener` | SpanProcessor | Observe/filter activities |

**Best practices:**
- Create `ActivitySource` as `static readonly` -- expensive to create, reuse throughout lifetime
- Use hierarchical names: `CephalonEngine.Behaviors`, `CephalonEngine.EventSourcing`
- Activity is only created if listeners are subscribed (zero cost when not observed)

---

## 12. Source Generators and Compile-Time

### Roslyn Incremental Source Generators

**What it does:** Compile-time code generation using the Roslyn compiler platform.

**Key concepts:**
- **`IIncrementalGenerator`** (Roslyn 4.x+) -- the ONLY generator API to use for .NET 7+
- **Pipeline model:** Declare transformation graph; Roslyn caches and replays incrementally
- **`ForAttributeWithMetadataName`** -- preferred entry point when targeting attributes
- **`CreateSyntaxProvider`** -- fallback when triggering on syntax structure without attributes

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine already has `Cephalon.Behaviors.SourceGen` (targets `netstandard2.0`, references `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp`, has `EnforceExtendedAnalyzerRules` and `IsRoslynComponent`). This is the correct setup for an incremental source generator.

**NOTE:** `ISourceGenerator` (the v1 API) is deprecated. The Roslyn team blocks access to older APIs after Roslyn 4.10.0 / .NET 9. Always use `IIncrementalGenerator`.

---

### Compile-Time DI Registration

Source generators can scan for types with specific attributes and emit registration code:

```
// Generator discovers [RegisterService] types and emits:
public static class GeneratedServiceRegistration
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddGeneratedServices(this IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSingleton<IFoo, Foo>();
        services.AddScoped<IBar, Bar>();
        return services;
    }
}
```

This eliminates manual `AddSingleton`/`AddScoped` calls and provides compile-time verification of registrations.

---

### Popular Source Generator Packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Mapperly** | Object mapping (compile-time AutoMapper alternative) |
| **StronglyTypedId** | Generate strongly-typed ID wrappers |
| **RapidEnum** | Fast enum utilities (zero allocation) |
| **MemoryPack** | Zero-encoding binary serializer |
| **Refit** | REST client generation from interfaces |
| **System.Text.Json** | JSON serialization context generation |
| **Facet** | DTO/ViewModel scaffolding with typed LINQ projections |

---

## 13. Middleware and Pipeline Libraries

### System.IO.Pipelines

**What it does:** High-performance I/O primitive for processing streams of bytes.

**Key features:**
- **`Pipe`** -- connects `PipeWriter` (producer) and `PipeReader` (consumer)
- **Back-pressure** via `PauseWriterThreshold` / `ResumeWriterThreshold`
- **`PipeScheduler`** -- controls which threads handle async callbacks
- **Zero-copy** where possible (works with `Memory<byte>`, `ReadOnlySequence<byte>`)
- Used internally by Kestrel, SignalR, and gRPC

**When to use:** Custom protocol implementations, high-throughput byte stream processing, network servers. Not for application-level middleware.

**Current version:** System.IO.Pipelines 10.0.0 (ships with .NET 10).

---

### Scrutor

**What it does:** Assembly scanning and decoration extensions for `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`.

**Key features:**
- **Assembly scanning** -- `services.Scan(scan => scan.FromAssemblyOf<T>().AddClasses(...).AsImplementedInterfaces())`
- **Service decoration** -- `services.Decorate<IService, DecoratedService>()` -- wraps existing registrations
- Convention-based registration (match by namespace, suffix, interface)

**When to use:** When you need assembly scanning or the Decorator pattern with the built-in DI container. Alternative to Autofac's scanning when you want to stay on the built-in container.

**Current version:** Scrutor 7.0.0 (November 2025). 3M+ downloads.

**Framework relevance:** CephalonEngine's module discovery could use Scrutor for scanning module assemblies for handler types, behavior implementations, and projection registrations.

---

### Middleware Pattern in CephalonEngine Context

The middleware/pipeline pattern appears in multiple layers:

1. **ASP.NET Core Middleware** -- `app.Use(...)` for HTTP request pipeline
2. **MediatR-style Pipeline Behaviors** -- `IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>` for command/query handling
3. **Wolverine Middleware** -- handler pipeline with before/after semantics
4. **EF Core Interceptors** -- `ISaveChangesInterceptor`, `IDbCommandInterceptor`
5. **CephalonEngine Behaviors** -- the engine's own pipeline via `Cephalon.Behaviors`

Each layer provides cross-cutting concern injection (logging, validation, transactions, auth) at different levels of the stack.
