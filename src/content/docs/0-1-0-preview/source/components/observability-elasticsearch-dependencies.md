`Cephalon.Observability.ElasticsearchDependencies` adds a supported Elasticsearch dependency-health path for Cephalon hosts.

## What it owns

- configuration binding for `Engine:Observability:DependencyHealth:Elasticsearch`
- background refresh of configured Elasticsearch cluster-health probes
- `IDependencyHealthContributor` registration over cached probe results so runtime health stays introspectable

## Main surfaces

- `Configuration/ElasticsearchDependencyDefinition.cs`
- `Configuration/ElasticsearchDependencyHealthOptions.cs`
- `Hosting/ElasticsearchDependencyHealthServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`
- `Services/ElasticsearchDependencyHealthProbeHostedService.cs`

## Source structure

- `Services`

## How it fits

This package keeps Elasticsearch-specific cluster-health checks out of `Cephalon.Engine` while still feeding the existing dependency-health contract. Hosts can opt into it when they need Elasticsearch clusters to surface through `/engine/dependencies`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, and `/engine/diagnostics` without re-implementing auth, endpoint, and status mapping rules per host. When active, it also publishes its probe event ids through the shared runtime diagnostics catalog.

Even though Elasticsearch uses HTTP, this pack stays separate from `Cephalon.Observability.HttpDependencies` because it owns Elasticsearch-specific endpoint shaping and payload-aware health mapping. That boundary keeps the generic HTTP probe pack reusable while still giving Elasticsearch operators a first-class contract.
