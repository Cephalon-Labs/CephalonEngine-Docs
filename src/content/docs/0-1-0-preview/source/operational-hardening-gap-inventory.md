title: Operational Hardening Gap Inventory
editUrl: false
---

This document records the current phase-2 operational hardening gap inventory for Cephalon as of `April 4, 2026`.

It is meant to answer two questions clearly:

1. What operational baseline is already shipped?
2. What still remained before phase 2 could be considered complete, and what moved into later phases?

## Shipped baseline

The repository already ships a meaningful operational baseline:

- health routes and shared runtime health semantics through `RuntimeHealthEvaluator`, `/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, and `/engine/dependencies`
- explicit runtime failure-policy configuration and restart guards through `Engine:FailurePolicy`, `/engine/failure-policy`, and `/engine/status`
- runtime diagnostics names and counters through `Cephalon.Engine` meter/activity source plus `/engine/diagnostics`
- operator-facing runtime snapshot aggregation through `/engine/snapshot`
- startup summaries and telemetry guidance logging through `Cephalon.Observability`
- reusable OTLP exporter wiring through `Cephalon.Observability.OpenTelemetry`
- benchmark guardrail validation through `Cephalon.Benchmarks`, `performance-guardrails.json`, and `scripts/validate-release.ps1`
- release-validation automation through `.github/workflows/release-validation.yml`

That means phase 2 is follow-through work, not greenfield operational work.

## Evidence in code

- health and dependency evaluation baseline:
  - `src/Cephalon.Engine/Runtime/RuntimeHealthEvaluator.cs`
  - `src/Cephalon.AspNetCore/Hosting/EngineWebApplicationExtensions.cs`
- runtime failure and restart baseline:
  - `src/Cephalon.Engine/Configuration/FailurePolicy.cs`
  - `src/Cephalon.Engine/Runtime/EngineRuntime.cs`
  - `docs/runtime-failure-policy.md`
- diagnostics and snapshot baseline:
  - `src/Cephalon.Engine/Diagnostics/EngineDiagnostics.cs`
  - `src/Cephalon.Engine/Runtime/RuntimeIntrospectionSnapshotProvider.cs`
  - `src/Cephalon.AspNetCore/Diagnostics/DiagnosticsSurface.cs`
- observability startup-summary baseline:
  - `src/Cephalon.Observability/Hosting/ManifestSummaryHostedService.cs`
  - `src/Cephalon.Observability/Configuration/TelemetryExportOptions.cs`
- observability exporter companion baseline:
  - `src/Cephalon.Observability.OpenTelemetry/Hosting/OpenTelemetryHostApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs`
- release-validation and benchmark baseline:
  - `benchmarks/Cephalon.Benchmarks/guardrails/performance-guardrails.json`
- `scripts/validate-release.ps1`
- `.github/workflows/release-validation.yml`
- prepared composition and runtime hot paths are benchmarked separately from builder/provider setup so the guardrail catalog tracks `Build()` and lifecycle costs directly
- the guardrail catalog now also covers strict trust-policy composition plus correlated, bounded-truncation, and concurrent ASP.NET Core request-logging paths with request/response body capture enabled

## Gap status mapped to backlog tasks

### `#32` Dedicated exporter or OpenTelemetry companion packaging

Current baseline:

- hosts can declare telemetry export intent through `Engine:Observability:Telemetry`
- `Cephalon.Observability` logs that guidance on startup
- `Cephalon.Observability.OpenTelemetry` now wires OTLP logs, metrics, and traces through `AddCephalonOpenTelemetry()`
- `Cephalon.Observability.Serilog` now wires Serilog through `AddCephalonSerilog()` while keeping the shared `ILogger` contract intact
- the shipped companion package supports `otlp`, `otlp/grpc`, and `otlp/http`, with automatic signal-path normalization for OTLP HTTP collectors
- the shipped OpenTelemetry baseline now also adds ASP.NET Core server tracing so request traces line up with Cephalon HTTP log correlation when hosts export traces

Outcome:

- exporter packaging should remain outside `Cephalon.Engine`
- the repository now ships a reusable companion package instead of leaving exporter wiring to sample-only host code
- remaining phase-2 work now sits primarily in phase-6 cloud tracing/export follow-through, with the self-hosted, Azure Monitor, AWS, GCP, Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and Red Hat OpenShift slices shipped, `#120` shipped as downstream Cloudflare/custom-provider guidance, `#126` shipped as the Grafana Cloud follow-through, and `#127` shipped as the New Relic native OTLP/api-key follow-through; any extra provider packs, downstream provider companions, or operator refinements stay adoption-driven expansion work

### `#87` `ILogger` provider wiring and Serilog host integration

Shipped follow-through:

- `Cephalon.Engine` and `Cephalon.Observability` continue to emit through `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger`
- `Cephalon.Observability.Serilog` now provides `AddCephalonSerilog()` for host-neutral Serilog registration on `IHostApplicationBuilder`
- the companion package reads the standard top-level `Serilog` section, supports code-based sink and enricher extension, and keeps registration additive to the shared `ILogger` pipeline
- `Cephalon.AspNetCore` now ships `Engine:Observability:HttpLogging` plus `AddCephalonHttpLogging()` for opt-in request/response summaries, bounded body capture, request-scope correlation, and default sensitive-value redaction across query-string, JSON, form, and header-style plain-text payloads over the same shared `ILogger` pipeline
- when ASP.NET Core request logging is enabled, Serilog receives `RequestId`, `TraceId`, `SpanId`, and `TraceParent` through the same MEL scope flow, so request diagnostics and trace exports stay linkable without a new Cephalon logger API

Why this stays separate:

- logging-provider selection is orthogonal to cloud tracing/export concerns
- Serilog now integrates as an `ILogger` provider, not as a new Cephalon logging surface

### `#86` Azure Monitor exporter and hosted Azure defaults on top of the OTLP baseline

Current baseline:

- hosts can declare telemetry export intent through `Engine:Observability:Telemetry`
- `Cephalon.Observability.OpenTelemetry` already wires OTLP logs, metrics, and traces through `AddCephalonOpenTelemetry()`
- the shipped OTLP baseline now includes ASP.NET Core server instrumentation so exported traces can correlate with Cephalon request logging
- the current shipped export story is cloud-neutral and works without locking Cephalon into one vendor/runtime target

Shipped result:

- the original later follow-through expanded into a broader cloud/platform companion track spanning self-hosted collectors and runtimes plus AWS, Azure, GCP, Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud, DigitalOcean, Red Hat OpenShift, VMware Tanzu, and Kubernetes, with Cloudflare now narrowed into a downstream/custom-provider guidance follow-through instead of a generic first-party sink package, Grafana Cloud now shipped as an explicit first-party target, and New Relic now shipped as the latest explicit first-party target
- the self-hosted slice is now shipped, `#86` has now shipped Azure Monitor exporter wiring plus hosted Azure defaults as the first explicit vendor-specific child under `ENG-029`, `#95` has now shipped the AWS follow-through as the second explicit vendor-specific child, `#98` has now shipped the GCP follow-through as the third explicit vendor-specific child, and `#102` has now shipped the Huawei Cloud follow-through as the fourth explicit vendor-specific child
- the Alibaba Cloud slice is now shipped under `#106`, the Red Hat OpenShift slice is now shipped under `#110`, the DigitalOcean slice is now shipped under `#114`, the VMware Tanzu slice is now shipped under `#118`, `#120` has now shipped the remaining Cloudflare follow-through as downstream/custom-provider guidance instead of leaving it folded into one ambiguous first-party package task, `#124` has now shipped the platform-neutral Kubernetes collector/defaults follow-through, `#125` has now shipped the Oracle Cloud managed-ingestion follow-through, `#126` has now shipped the Grafana Cloud OTLP/header follow-through, and `#127` has now shipped the New Relic native OTLP/api-key follow-through

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export work is deployment-context-specific
- Azure-specific exporter wiring, auth, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- Azure is the cleanest first vendor-specific slice after the shipped self-hosted path because Cephalon already centers .NET host composition and operational guidance without needing to reopen phase 2

### `#95` AWS observability exporter wiring and hosted AWS defaults on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- `Cephalon.Observability.Aws` now ships AWS-specific companion wiring on top of the shared OpenTelemetry baseline, including X-Ray-compatible trace IDs and propagation, AWS SDK instrumentation, and hosted defaults for the supported AWS runtimes
- the AWS slice keeps cloud-specific behavior in companion packages instead of moving it back into `Cephalon.Engine`
- the GCP, Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Red Hat OpenShift, DigitalOcean, VMware Tanzu, and Kubernetes slices have now shipped alongside the Azure and AWS slices, and `#120` has now shipped the remaining Cloudflare/downstream guidance follow-through

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export work is deployment-context-specific
- AWS-specific exporter wiring, auth, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- AWS was the clean next vendor-specific slice after the shipped self-hosted plus Azure path because it kept ECS, EKS, EC2, and related hosted defaults explicit without pretending the broader provider matrix was one task

### `#98` GCP observability exporter wiring and hosted GCP defaults on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- hosts can declare telemetry export intent through `Engine:Observability:Telemetry`
- `Cephalon.Observability.OpenTelemetry` already wires OTLP logs, metrics, and traces through `AddCephalonOpenTelemetry()`
- the shipped OTLP baseline now includes ASP.NET Core server instrumentation so exported traces can correlate with Cephalon request logging
- `Cephalon.Observability.Gcp` now ships GCP-specific companion wiring on top of the shared OpenTelemetry baseline, including hosted GCP defaults plus an optional Google-managed traces/metrics path
- the shipped self-hosted, Azure Monitor, AWS, GCP, Huawei Cloud, and Oracle Cloud slices keep cloud-specific behavior in companion packages instead of moving it back into `Cephalon.Engine`
- the Alibaba Cloud slice is now shipped under `#106`, the Red Hat OpenShift slice is now shipped under `#110`, the DigitalOcean slice is now shipped under `#114`, the VMware Tanzu slice is now shipped under `#118`, `#120` has now shipped the remaining Cloudflare/downstream guidance follow-through, `#124` has now shipped the platform-neutral Kubernetes collector/defaults follow-through, and `#125` has now shipped the Oracle Cloud managed-ingestion follow-through

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export work is deployment-context-specific
- GCP-specific exporter wiring, auth, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- GCP was the clean next vendor-specific slice after the shipped self-hosted plus Azure plus AWS path because it keeps GKE, GCE, Cloud Run, and related hosted defaults explicit without pretending the broader provider matrix is one task

### `#102` Huawei Cloud observability exporter wiring and hosted Huawei Cloud defaults on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- hosts can already declare telemetry export intent through `Engine:Observability:Telemetry`, and `Cephalon.Observability.OpenTelemetry` already wires the shared OTLP logs, metrics, and traces baseline
- the shipped self-hosted, Azure Monitor, AWS, and GCP slices proved the companion-package model and kept cloud-specific behavior outside `Cephalon.Engine`, and `Cephalon.Observability.HuaweiCloud` now extends that same pattern for Huawei Cloud
- the Huawei Cloud package now supports hosted defaults for ECS, CCE, and FunctionGraph plus an opt-in direct Huawei Cloud APM trace-ingestion path that uses the required `Authentication` header without inventing a new logging abstraction or reopening phase 2
- the shipped Huawei Cloud slice keeps logs and metrics on the shared collector-oriented path while making the direct managed APM route trace-only, which keeps the contract truthful to the documented Huawei Cloud path instead of over-claiming broader managed-signal support
- the Alibaba Cloud slice is now shipped under `#106`, the Red Hat OpenShift slice is now shipped under `#110`, the DigitalOcean slice is now shipped under `#114`, the VMware Tanzu slice is now shipped under `#118`, `#120` has now shipped the remaining Cloudflare/downstream guidance follow-up work, and `#124` has now shipped the platform-neutral Kubernetes collector/defaults follow-through

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export work is deployment-context-specific
- Huawei Cloud-specific exporter wiring, auth, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- Huawei Cloud stayed in phase 6 because its exporter wiring, auth/header behavior, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belonged in a companion package rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2

### `#106` Alibaba Cloud observability exporter wiring and hosted Alibaba Cloud defaults on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- hosts can already declare telemetry export intent through `Engine:Observability:Telemetry`, and `Cephalon.Observability.OpenTelemetry` already wires the shared OTLP logs, metrics, and traces baseline
- the shipped self-hosted, Azure Monitor, AWS, GCP, and Huawei Cloud slices proved the companion-package model and kept cloud-specific behavior outside `Cephalon.Engine`, and `Cephalon.Observability.AlibabaCloud` now extends that same pattern for Alibaba Cloud
- the Alibaba Cloud package now supports hosted defaults for ECS, Function Compute, and Alibaba-managed OpenShift conventions plus an opt-in direct Managed Service for OpenTelemetry ingestion path without inventing a new logging abstraction or reopening phase 2
- the shipped Alibaba Cloud slice keeps the shared collector-first path intact, supports direct managed gRPC traces and metrics with the required `Authentication` header, and supports tokenized managed HTTP traces and metrics endpoints when teams need a direct hosted path
- docs, validation, and reference-doc publishing now treat Alibaba Cloud as a shipped first-party companion package, while the downstream companion-package authoring path stays explicit for teams targeting later providers

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export work is deployment-context-specific
- Alibaba Cloud-specific exporter wiring, auth, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- Alibaba Cloud stayed in phase 6 because its documented managed OpenTelemetry path mapped cleanly onto the shipped Cephalon observability baseline without turning the still-later Cloudflare and VMware Tanzu work back into one ambiguous multi-provider task

### `#110` Red Hat OpenShift collector wiring and hosted OpenShift defaults on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- hosts can already declare telemetry export intent through `Engine:Observability:Telemetry`, and `Cephalon.Observability.OpenTelemetry` already wires the shared OTLP logs, metrics, and traces baseline
- the shipped self-hosted, Azure Monitor, AWS, GCP, Huawei Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud slices proved the companion-package model and kept cloud-specific behavior outside `Cephalon.Engine`, and `Cephalon.Observability.OpenShift` now extends that same pattern for Red Hat OpenShift
- the OpenShift package now supports hosted cluster defaults, in-cluster collector-service discovery, explicit OTLP headers, and optional HTTPS trusted-CA bundle handling for OTLP/HTTP traces and metrics without inventing a new logging abstraction or reopening phase 2
- the shipped OpenShift slice keeps the shared collector-first path intact, adds platform-specific resource defaults for `openshift`, `aro`, and `rosa`, and rejects unsupported custom-CA OTLP logging combinations early instead of pretending the current exporter surface supports them
- docs, validation, and reference-doc publishing now treat Red Hat OpenShift as a shipped first-party companion package, while the downstream companion-package authoring path stays explicit for teams targeting later providers

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export work is deployment-context-specific
- OpenShift-specific collector wiring, trust inputs, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- OpenShift stayed in phase 6 because its documented operator-managed OTLP path mapped cleanly onto the shipped Cephalon observability baseline without turning the still-later Cloudflare and VMware Tanzu work back into one ambiguous multi-provider task

### `#114` DigitalOcean collector wiring and hosted DigitalOcean defaults on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- `Cephalon.Observability.DigitalOcean` now ships DigitalOcean-specific companion wiring on top of the shared OpenTelemetry baseline, including shared OTLP endpoint reuse, `UseSelfHostedDefaults`, and DOKS in-cluster collector-service discovery
- the DigitalOcean slice keeps cloud-specific behavior in companion packages instead of moving it back into `Cephalon.Engine`
- the package now supports best-effort Droplet metadata defaults plus App Platform and DOKS resource conventions without inventing a new logging abstraction or over-claiming a managed DigitalOcean OTLP exporter path
- docs, validation, and reference-doc publishing now treat DigitalOcean as a shipped first-party companion package, while the downstream companion-package authoring path stays explicit for later providers

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export work is deployment-context-specific
- DigitalOcean-specific collector wiring, runtime defaults, resource attributes, and any optional provider handoff still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- DigitalOcean stayed in phase 6 because the current documented DigitalOcean observability path mapped more cleanly onto the shipped collector-first Cephalon baseline than onto a direct managed-exporter story, and scoping it as `#114` kept Cloudflare and VMware Tanzu out of the same ambiguous task

### `#118` VMware Tanzu proxy handoff and hosted Tanzu defaults on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- `Cephalon.Observability.Tanzu` now ships Tanzu-specific companion wiring on top of the shared OpenTelemetry baseline, including shared OTLP endpoint reuse, `UseSelfHostedDefaults`, and explicit in-cluster proxy-service discovery for trace-focused handoff
- the Tanzu slice keeps cloud-specific behavior in companion packages instead of moving it back into `Cephalon.Engine`
- the package now supports hosted defaults for TKG, TKGI, and TAP plus optional OTLP headers, optional HTTPS trusted-CA bundle handling, and explicit proxy base-path/service discovery without inventing a new logging abstraction
- the shipped Tanzu slice keeps the shared OTLP path intact for logs and metrics, makes the in-cluster proxy handoff path trace-only, and avoids pretending the current Tanzu docs promise one generic managed OTLP exporter path for every signal
- docs, validation, and reference-doc publishing now treat VMware Tanzu as a shipped first-party companion package, while the downstream companion-package authoring path stays explicit for later providers

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export work is deployment-context-specific
- VMware Tanzu-specific proxy inputs, auth handoff, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- VMware Tanzu stays in phase 6 because the current documented Tanzu observability path maps more cleanly onto the shipped platform-first Cephalon baseline than onto a direct managed-exporter story, and scoping it as `#118` keeps Cloudflare out of the same ambiguous task

### `#120` Cloudflare and downstream provider authoring guidance on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- `docs/observability-provider-authoring.md` now documents the downstream companion-package path explicitly, including package shape, shared-contract binding, startup-summary expectations, and validation rules
- the shipped guidance keeps Cloudflare-specific follow-through truthful by documenting the current Worker-native export model instead of claiming that Cloudflare already exposes a generic OTLP ingestion target for external Cephalon hosts
- the observability baseline docs, OpenTelemetry docs, operations guide, docs hub, and root README now all point to the same downstream authoring path for Cloudflare and internal-provider integrations
- the shipped guidance keeps Cloudflare and similar custom-provider work additive on top of `Engine:Observability:Telemetry`, `IDiagnosticsConventionContributor`, `IHostedService`, and the shared `ILogger` pipeline rather than pushing new abstractions into the engine core

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export and edge-platform observability work is deployment-context-specific
- any Cloudflare-specific guidance still belongs in companion-pack and operational guidance rather than `Cephalon.Engine` or `Cephalon.Abstractions`
- narrowing this slice to downstream authoring guidance keeps the planning truthful while preserving room for a future first-party package only if Cloudflare later exposes a documented host-side ingestion story that matches Cephalon's runtime model

### `#124` Kubernetes collector wiring and hosted Kubernetes defaults on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- `Cephalon.Observability.Kubernetes` now ships a platform-neutral Kubernetes companion on top of the shared OpenTelemetry baseline, including in-cluster collector-service discovery, shared OTLP endpoint reuse, and generic cluster resource defaults
- the Kubernetes slice keeps cluster-specific collector wiring, DNS assumptions, resource attributes, and optional trust inputs inside a companion package instead of moving them back into `Cephalon.Engine`
- the package now supports generic Kubernetes defaults for cluster name, namespace, pod, node, and container resource attributes plus optional collector headers and optional HTTPS trusted-CA bundle handling for OTLP/HTTP traces and metrics without inventing a new logging abstraction
- the shipped Kubernetes slice keeps the shared collector-first path intact, supports self-managed and managed Kubernetes clusters through explicit service-DNS suffix and collector-service configuration, and rejects unsupported custom-CA OTLP logging combinations early instead of pretending the current exporter surface supports them
- docs, validation, and reference-doc publishing now treat Kubernetes as a shipped first-party companion package, while the downstream companion-package authoring path stays explicit for later providers and edge targets

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export and platform observability work is deployment-context-specific
- Kubernetes-specific collector wiring, trust inputs, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- scoping Kubernetes as `#124` keeps the generic cluster-first path explicit without folding it back into the OpenShift, DigitalOcean, Tanzu, or downstream custom-provider slices

### `#125` Oracle Cloud observability exporter wiring and hosted Oracle Cloud defaults on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- `Cephalon.Observability.OracleCloud` now ships an Oracle Cloud companion on top of the shared OpenTelemetry baseline, including hosted Oracle Cloud defaults plus an opt-in Oracle Cloud APM managed traces/metrics path
- the Oracle Cloud slice keeps Oracle-specific data-upload endpoint shaping, data-key header rules, resource attributes, and hosted defaults inside a companion package instead of moving them back into `Cephalon.Engine`
- the package now supports hosted defaults for Compute, OKE, and Functions plus explicit `cloud.region` stamping without inventing a new logging abstraction
- the shipped Oracle Cloud slice keeps the shared collector-first path intact, requires OTLP/HTTP for direct Oracle Cloud APM ingestion, and keeps logs on the shared collector path or another runtime-specific route instead of pretending Oracle Cloud APM already covers every signal through the same direct path
- docs, validation, and reference-doc publishing now treat Oracle Cloud as a shipped first-party companion package, while the downstream companion-package authoring path stays explicit for later providers and edge targets

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export and platform observability work is deployment-context-specific
- Oracle Cloud-specific data-upload endpoints, data-key rules, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- scoping Oracle Cloud as `#125` keeps the Oracle Cloud APM managed-ingestion path explicit without folding it back into the Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Kubernetes, or downstream custom-provider slices

Shipped result:

- `Cephalon.Observability.GrafanaCloud` now ships a Grafana Cloud companion on top of the shared OTLP baseline, including explicit direct OTLP endpoint wiring plus access-policy-backed authentication guidance
- the shipped self-hosted, Azure Monitor, AWS, GCP, Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud, OpenShift, DigitalOcean, Tanzu, and Kubernetes slices plus the shipped `#120` downstream Cloudflare/custom-provider guidance still prove the same companion-package model without moving cloud-specific behavior back into `Cephalon.Engine`
- the shipped Grafana Cloud slice keeps the shared collector-first baseline, `UseSelfHostedDefaults`, and the downstream custom-provider story intact instead of forcing every host onto a vendor-direct path
- the package now supports either raw OTLP `Headers` or a structured `InstanceId` plus `AccessPolicyToken` pair, while `ServiceNamespace` and the active host environment keep resource context explicit without inventing a new logging abstraction
- docs, validation, and reference-doc publishing now treat Grafana Cloud as a shipped first-party companion package instead of a speculative remaining-provider placeholder

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export and platform observability work is deployment-context-specific
- Grafana Cloud-specific OTLP endpoints, auth headers, tenant inputs, resource attributes, and hosted defaults still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- scoping Grafana Cloud as `#126` kept that OTLP endpoint/auth-header slice explicit without folding it back into Oracle Cloud, Kubernetes, Cloudflare, or downstream custom-provider guidance

### `#127` New Relic OTLP endpoint wiring and api-key guidance on top of the OTLP baseline

Shipped result:

- `Cephalon.Observability.NewRelic` now ships a New Relic companion on top of the shared OTLP baseline, including region-aware direct OTLP endpoint defaults plus `api-key`-backed authentication guidance
- the shipped self-hosted, Azure Monitor, AWS, GCP, Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud, OpenShift, DigitalOcean, Tanzu, Kubernetes, and Grafana Cloud slices plus the shipped `#120` downstream Cloudflare/custom-provider guidance still prove the same companion-package model without moving cloud-specific behavior back into `Cephalon.Engine`
- the shipped New Relic slice keeps the shared collector-first baseline, `UseSelfHostedDefaults`, and the downstream custom-provider story intact instead of forcing every host onto a vendor-direct path
- the package now supports either raw OTLP `Headers` or a structured `LicenseKey` plus regional endpoint-default flow, while `ServiceNamespace` and the active host environment keep resource context explicit without inventing a new logging abstraction

Why this target stays in phase 6:

- cloud tracing/export and platform observability work is deployment-context-specific
- New Relic-specific OTLP endpoints, `api-key` headers, tenant-region defaults, and hosted guidance still belong in companion packages rather than the reusable host/runtime primitives shipped in phase 2
- scoping New Relic as `#127` kept that native OTLP endpoint/api-key slice explicit without folding it back into Grafana Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Kubernetes, Cloudflare, or downstream custom-provider guidance

### `#33` Baseline provider-specific dependency health companion packages

Shipped scope:

- `IDependencyHealthContributor` exists
- `RuntimeHealthEvaluator` aggregates dependency reports cleanly

- `Cephalon.Observability.ElasticsearchDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for Elasticsearch clusters, including cluster-health requests plus API-key, bearer-token, or basic-auth handling
- `Cephalon.Observability.HttpDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for external HTTP and API upstreams
- `Cephalon.Observability.KafkaDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for Kafka brokers, including bootstrap-server metadata checks plus optional topic verification and SASL/security protocol selection
- `Cephalon.Observability.MemcachedDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for Memcached cache endpoints, including text-protocol `version` verification over TCP
- `Cephalon.Observability.MongoDbDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for MongoDB databases, including connection-string or host/database configuration plus TLS and direct-connection controls
- `Cephalon.Observability.MqttDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for MQTT brokers, including protocol-level `CONNECT`, `CONNACK`, and `PINGREQ`/`PINGRESP` verification plus explicit username/password and TLS settings

- `Cephalon.Observability.NatsDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for NATS brokers, including protocol-level `INFO`, `CONNECT`, and `PING`/`PONG` verification plus explicit token or username/password auth settings
- `Cephalon.Observability.ClickHouseDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for ClickHouse analytics databases, including connection-string or host/protocol/database configuration plus configurable health queries
- `Cephalon.Observability.Neo4jDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for Neo4j graph endpoints, including endpoint URIs or host/port/scheme configuration plus optional database selection and configurable Cypher health queries
- `Cephalon.Observability.OpenSearchDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for OpenSearch clusters, including base-URL or full cluster-health endpoint configuration plus optional index selection and bearer/basic auth support
- `Cephalon.Observability.CassandraDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for Cassandra clusters, including contact-point lists, optional keyspace selection, credentials, and configurable CQL health queries
- `Cephalon.Observability.OracleDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for Oracle databases, including connection-string or host/service-name configuration plus configurable health queries
- `Cephalon.Observability.PostgresDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for Postgres databases, including connection-string or host/database configuration plus configurable health queries

- `Cephalon.Observability.RedisDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for Redis and cache endpoints, including auth and logical database selection
- `Cephalon.Observability.SqlServerDependencies` now provides a reusable provider-specific pack for SQL Server and Azure SQL databases, including connection-string or host/database configuration plus configurable health queries and encryption mode selection

Outcome:

- the current phase-2 baseline provider set is now shipped across Cassandra cluster endpoints plus ClickHouse analytics endpoints plus Consul control-plane endpoints plus Elasticsearch cluster endpoints plus external HTTP/API upstreams plus Kafka broker metadata endpoints plus Memcached cache endpoints plus MongoDB document-database endpoints plus MQTT broker endpoints plus MySQL/MariaDB database endpoints plus NATS broker endpoints plus Neo4j graph endpoints plus OpenSearch cluster endpoints plus Oracle database endpoints plus Postgres database endpoints plus RabbitMQ broker endpoints plus Redis/cache endpoints plus SQL Server and Azure SQL endpoints
- additional provider-specific packs can land later as explicit adoption-driven expansion work instead of remaining part of this baseline task
- `Cephalon.Observability.HttpDependencies` should continue growing along generic HTTP semantics instead of absorbing product-aware response mapping; HTTP-based systems such as Elasticsearch stay in dedicated packs when they need first-class endpoint or payload contracts
- `Cephalon.Observability.NatsDependencies` can continue growing across NATS-native wire semantics without forcing unrelated workload semantics into the shared broker baseline

Why this stays separate:

- the contributor contract is already good enough
- future provider-pack additions should stay adoption-driven instead of reopening the current baseline task

### `#34` Structured diagnostics and event IDs across packages

Current baseline:

- `Cephalon.Engine` already emits structured runtime/module transition and failure logs with event ids in the `2000` range
- `Cephalon.Observability` already emits startup-summary, diagnostics-catalog, and telemetry-guidance logs with event ids in the `3000` range
- active engine and companion packages now publish their diagnostics conventions through `IRuntimeDiagnosticsCatalog`, `/engine/diagnostics`, and `/engine/snapshot`
- currently shipped package coverage includes `Cephalon.Engine`, `Cephalon.Observability`, `Cephalon.Observability.CassandraDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.ClickHouseDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.ConsulDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.ElasticsearchDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.HttpDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.KafkaDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.MemcachedDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.MongoDbDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.MqttDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.MySqlDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.NatsDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.Neo4jDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.OpenSearchDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.OracleDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.PostgresDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.RabbitMqDependencies`, `Cephalon.Observability.RedisDependencies`, and `Cephalon.Observability.SqlServerDependencies`

Gap:

- the currently shipped packages now share one published event-id catalog and package-by-package diagnostics convention
- future packages should follow the same contributor model when they add new operator-facing structured logs, but that no longer blocks the current phase-2 diagnostics baseline

Why this stays separate:

- the engine baseline exists and is now widened across the active observability packages
- remaining phase-2 work shifts to richer runtime answers rather than inventing another diagnostics abstraction for the current shipped set

### `#35` Clearer runtime answers for what loaded, started, failed, and why

Current baseline:

- `/engine/status`, `/engine/packages`, `/engine/dependencies`, `/engine/diagnostics`, and `/engine/snapshot` already expose useful point-in-time answers
- `/engine/runtime-story` now combines loaded packages, per-module lifecycle state, and an ordered runtime timeline into one operator-facing payload
- `IRuntime.OperationalStory` keeps the same lifecycle narrative available outside ASP.NET Core hosts
- `/engine/snapshot` now folds that runtime story into the broader manifest/status/technology/diagnostics payload

Outcome:

- operators now have one host-level route and one host-agnostic runtime contract for answering what loaded, what started, what failed, and why
- the runtime story keeps package load visibility, module lifecycle state, and ordered timeline events aligned without inventing a second manifest or health abstraction

Why this stays separate:

- no new engine abstraction is obviously missing yet
- the follow-through improved operator answers without duplicating the existing manifest/status/health surfaces

### `#73` Deeper readiness/liveness semantics and richer restart or backoff policy

Shipped follow-through:

- `Engine:FailurePolicy` now exposes `StartupReadinessDelay`, `ShutdownLivenessGracePeriod`, and `ManualRestartBackoff`
- `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, and `/engine/diagnostics` now surface active lifecycle windows such as startup warmup, shutdown drain, and restart backoff
- `/engine/status` and `/engine/runtime-story` now expose shutdown timing and restart-availability timestamps for restartable failures

What still stays later:

- dependency-specific grace periods or maintenance-mode policy are still optional follow-through, not part of the shipped baseline

### `#74` Release-validation guidance for health and export conventions

Shipped follow-through:

- `scripts/validate-operational-conventions.ps1` now gives operators and maintainers a focused validation pass for ASP.NET Core health routes, worker-host health parity, observability startup guidance, Serilog provider wiring, and OTLP exporter wiring
- `scripts/validate-release.ps1` now runs that focused operational suite explicitly alongside the broader build, test, benchmark, guardrail, and reference-doc flow

Why this stays separate:

- the follow-through turns a previously implicit convention check into an explicit, repeatable release signal without moving exporter dependencies or health semantics back into the engine core

## Planning outcome

Current conclusion from this inventory:

- the phase-2 child-task split served its purpose for the shipped baseline; with the self-hosted, Azure, AWS, GCP, Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Red Hat OpenShift, DigitalOcean, VMware Tanzu, Kubernetes, Cloudflare/downstream guidance, Grafana Cloud, and New Relic slices complete, any future provider addition can stay explicit instead of reopening the broader provider matrix
- phase 2 can now be treated as substantially complete on top of a shipped provider/logging/runtime-surface baseline, with any extra provider packs still treated as future adoption-driven expansion

Recommended execution sequence now is:

1. treat phase 2 as complete for the shipped operational baseline
2. keep `ENG-029` in phase 6 cloud and platform integrations as a `later / Todo` expansion area until another explicit provider or platform target becomes adoption-driven, with any future first-party Cloudflare package still gated on a later explicit child and a clearer platform-side host-ingestion story
3. keep adoption-driven provider-pack additions separate beyond the shipped New Relic slice, and keep the downstream companion-package story explicit for teams that need to implement their own provider path
