`Cephalon.Data.MySql` is the MySQL provider-native CDC companion pack for Cephalon. It proves that the shared `Cephalon.Data` CDC execution and runtime catalog family also fits a binlog-backed relational source with durable file-plus-position checkpoints, provider-owned execution, source-server identity plus binlog lifecycle validation, and module-preserving capture ownership truth without a MySQL-specific registry in `Cephalon.Engine`.

## What it owns

- contributes configured provider-native MySQL binlog captures through `MySqlBinlogCaptureOptions` and keeps those descriptors on the shared `/engine/cdc-captures*` catalog with `provider = "mysql"` and `mode = "binlog"`
- publishes capability metadata `data.mysql`, `data.relational-store`, and `data.cdc.mysql` introspectable at runtime through the manifest
- publishes the provider-native CDC execution graph `mysql-binlog-capture-flow`, hosted execution `mysql-binlog-capture-pump`, and execution runtime `mysql-binlog-capture-pump` when MySQL binlog captures are configured
- runs a provider-native hosted service that validates source-server identity and retained-binlog lifecycle posture, resolves start position from the Cephalon-managed checkpoint table or from the configured initial binlog posture, reads one bounded binlog row-event batch, stages outbox publications, persists the next durable binlog checkpoint only after outbox stage success, and reports runtime posture through the shared `ICdcCaptureRuntimeReporter` surface
- stores durable MySQL binlog checkpoints in a Cephalon-managed checkpoint table, defaulting to `cephalon_cdc_checkpoints`
- extends that checkpoint table with provider-native resume metadata such as `SourceServerUuid`, `SourceServerId`, `GtidExecutedSet`, `BinlogFormat`, and `BinlogRowImage` so restart-safe operator truth stays on the shared CDC surfaces instead of a provider-local registry
- preserves authored capture ownership through `CdcCaptureDescriptor.SourceModuleId` while surfacing `metadata.contributorModuleId = "mysql-data"` when the provider pack contributes the descriptor on behalf of another module

## Main surfaces

- `Configuration/MySqlDataOptions.cs`
- `Configuration/MySqlBinlogCaptureOptions.cs`
- `Modules/MySqlDataModule.cs`
- `Registration/MySqlDataEngineBuilderExtensions.cs`
- `Services/IMySqlBinlogTransport.cs`
- `Services/MySqlBinlogCaptureHostedService.cs`
- `Services/MySqlBinlogCheckpointToken.cs`
- `Services/MySqlBinlogExecutionRuntimeContributor.cs`
- `Services/MySqlBinlogTransport.cs`
- `Services/MySqlDataRuntimeIds.cs`

## How it fits

This pack sits on top of `Cephalon.Data`, not in place of it. `Cephalon.Data` still owns the runtime-neutral CDC descriptor catalog, capture-side execution binding, shared runtime-state catalog, additive execution-runtime catalog, external runtime reporting seam, and the shared `/engine/cdc-*`, `/engine/execution-graphs`, `/engine/hosted-executions`, `/engine/runtime-story`, and `snapshot` truth model. `Cephalon.Data.MySql` adds the MySQL-specific binlog reader, file-plus-position checkpoint store, and provider-native hosted execution loop needed to project truthful MySQL behavior into those shared surfaces.

That keeps the engine honest. The shared `data-cdc-capture-pump` still exists as the generic in-process runtime, but it simply ignores captures whose effective owner resolves to `mysql-binlog-capture-pump`. The MySQL pack becomes the fourth concrete provider-native CDC runner after MongoDB, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, and the first explicit MySQL binlog proof on the same ownership and topology model.

The slice stays intentionally scoped. `Cephalon.Data.MySql` does not claim general-purpose `IReadStore` or `IWriteStore` dispatch, Entity Framework integration, MySQL-backed outbox or inbox storage, GTID-based failover orchestration, or a MySQL-specific operator registry outside the shared runtime story. If a host wants relational read or write persistence today, `Cephalon.Data.EntityFramework` remains the honest baseline. `Cephalon.Data.MySql` claims provider-native CDC capture, source-server identity plus binlog lifecycle validation, GTID observe-only metadata, and durable checkpoint truth on the shared runtime surfaces.

## Registration

```csharp
engine.AddData(options =>
{
    options.EnableCdcExecution = true;
});

engine.AddMySqlData(
    connectionString: "Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=app;User ID=root;Password=mysql",
    databaseName: "app",
    configure: options =>
    {
        options.CdcCaptures.Add(new MySqlBinlogCaptureOptions
        {
            Id = "orders-cdc",
            DisplayName = "Orders CDC",
            SourceModuleId = "orders",
            TableSchema = "app",
            TableName = "orders",
            ServerId = 700001,
            OutboxId = "tenant-event-outbox",
            ChannelId = "orders",
            MessageType = "OrdersChanged"
        });
    });
```

For configuration-driven hosts, prefer the options overload and bind from `Engine:Data:MySql`:

```csharp
engine.AddData(options =>
{
    options.EnableCdcExecution = true;
});

engine.AddMySqlData(options =>
{
    configuration.GetSection(MySqlDataOptions.SectionPath).Bind(options);
    options.ConnectionStringName ??= "MySql";
    options.DatabaseName = "app";
});
```

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MySql": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=app;User ID=root;Password=mysql"
  },
  "Engine": {
    "Data": {
      "MySql": {
        "ConnectionStringName": "MySql",
        "DatabaseName": "app",
        "CheckpointTableName": "cephalon_cdc_checkpoints",
        "CdcCaptures": [
          {
            "Id": "orders-cdc",
            "DisplayName": "Orders CDC",
            "SourceModuleId": "orders",
            "TableSchema": "app",
            "TableName": "orders",
            "ServerId": 700001,
            "OutboxId": "tenant-event-outbox",
            "ChannelId": "orders",
            "MessageType": "OrdersChanged",
            "InitialPosition": "latest-available",
            "MaxChangesPerRead": 128,
            "MaxAwaitTimeSeconds": 5,
            "PollingIntervalSeconds": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`ConnectionStringName` and `ConnectionString` are mutually exclusive. If both are set, the pack fails fast during service resolution. If neither is set, the MySQL provider cannot start.

## Provider-native CDC runtime

When `CdcCaptures` are configured:

- each capture is published through `/engine/cdc-captures*` with `provider = "mysql"`, `mode = "binlog"`, and an `executionBinding` whose authored and requested runtime id is `mysql-binlog-capture-pump`
- the execution runtime is published through `/engine/cdc-capture-runtimes*` and `snapshot.CdcCaptureExecutionRuntimes` with `executionOwnership = host-managed`, `executionTopology = provider-native`, and `acknowledgementMode = provider-native`
- the same runtime publishes through `/engine/execution-graphs`, `/engine/hosted-executions`, `/engine/runtime-story`, and `snapshot` under `mysql-binlog-capture-flow` plus `mysql-binlog-capture-pump`
- the hosted runner resolves its starting point from the durable Cephalon checkpoint row when one exists, otherwise from the configured initial binlog posture, validates retained-binlog lifecycle posture plus optional `ExpectedSourceServerUuid`, reads one bounded row-event batch per iteration, stages one outbox message per captured row change, and only persists the next durable checkpoint after the linked outbox accepted the batch
- each staged outbox message uses content type `application/vnd.cephalon.mysql.binlog+json`, keeps deterministic change ids and checkpoint tokens, and publishes operator-facing metadata such as `binlogFile`, `binlogPosition`, `binlogResumeMode`, `binlogLifecycleState`, `binlogLifecycleAction`, `checkpointStore`, `binlogCheckpointSource`, `sourceServerUuid`, `sourceServerIdentityState`, `sourceServerIdentityAction`, `gtidMode`, and `gtidExecutedSet` on the same shared runtime story
- the transport intentionally uses the installed `SciSharp.MySQL.Replication` client together with a thin internal adapter path so Cephalon can keep explicit start-position ownership and durable checkpoint truth on the shared runtime surfaces instead of inventing a MySQL-only monitor or start-position registry

### Checkpoint table schema (`cephalon_cdc_checkpoints`)

The default table name is `CheckpointTableName`.

| Column | SQL type | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `CdcCaptureId` | `varchar(128)` | Stable CDC capture id; one checkpoint row per capture |
| `BinlogFile` | `varchar(255)` | Latest durable binlog file name |
| `BinlogPosition` | `bigint` | Latest durable file position |
| `CheckpointToken` | `varchar(512)` | Serialized checkpoint token in `binlogFile|position` form |
| `SourceServerUuid` | `varchar(128)` | Last observed MySQL source-server UUID captured with the durable checkpoint |
| `SourceServerId` | `bigint` | Last observed MySQL source-server id captured with the durable checkpoint |
| `GtidExecutedSet` | `longtext` | Last observed GTID set kept for operator diagnostics and resume context |
| `BinlogFormat` | `varchar(32)` | Last observed MySQL `binlog_format` value |
| `BinlogRowImage` | `varchar(32)` | Last observed MySQL `binlog_row_image` value |
| `UpdatedAtUtc` | `datetime(6)` | UTC timestamp of the last durable checkpoint write |

## Lifecycle and resume metadata

The provider-native MySQL runner keeps lifecycle and resume truth on the existing shared CDC runtime surfaces rather than on a provider-local operator endpoint.

Important metadata families now include:

- `binlogResumeMode`, `resumeCheckpoint`, `checkpointUpdatedAtUtc`, and `checkpoint*` metadata so operators can see whether the runner started from a durable checkpoint or from a configured initial posture
- `binlogLifecycleState` plus `binlogLifecycleAction` so retained-binlog validation can distinguish available, purged, or unavailable lifecycle posture before the runner starts reading
- `sourceServerUuid`, `sourceServerId`, `sourceServerIdentityState`, `sourceServerIdentityAction`, `checkpointSourceServerUuid`, and `checkpointSourceServerId` so restart-safe source-server identity truth stays visible during resume, mismatch, and fail-fast paths
- `gtidMode`, `gtidExecutedSet`, `checkpointGtidExecutedSet`, `binlogFormat`, `binlogRowImage`, and matching checkpoint metadata so hosts can observe provider-native replication posture without Cephalon claiming GTID-driven takeover orchestration

Representative failure kinds now include:

- `binary-logging-disabled`
- `binlog-format-unsupported`
- `source-server-identity-unavailable`
- `source-server-mismatch`
- `checkpoint-source-server-mismatch`
- `checkpoint-binlog-unavailable`

## Runtime capabilities

When `MySqlDataModule` is active, the following capability keys appear in the runtime manifest:

| Capability key | When registered |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `data.mysql` | Always |
| `data.relational-store` | Always |
| `data.cdc.mysql` | `CdcCaptures.Count > 0` |

## Not shipped in this slice

This pack intentionally still does not claim:

- `IReadStore` or `IWriteStore` dispatch backed directly by MySQL
- Entity Framework or `DbContext` integration
- MySQL-backed `IOutbox`, `IInbox`, or event-dispatch storage
- GTID-based resume or failover orchestration beyond observe-only metadata
- Debezium or out-of-process MySQL CDC execution ownership beyond the shared `/engine/cdc-*` topology surfaces
- low-code generation or multi-table orchestration beyond one configured capture per table path

These remain later slices so the current provider claim stays truthful.
