`Cephalon.Observability.NewRelic` adds New Relic native OTLP endpoint defaults for Cephalon hosts.

## What it owns

- host-builder registration for OTLP logs, metrics, and traces over the shared `Engine:Observability:Telemetry` contract when a shared collector endpoint is already in place
- an opt-in New Relic native OTLP path that can derive the documented regional endpoints or use an explicit OTLP endpoint override
- `api-key` header guidance from either raw OTLP headers or a structured New Relic license-key setting
- startup diagnostics that summarize the active New Relic export mode without logging secrets

## Main surfaces

- `Configuration/NewRelicTelemetryExportOptions.cs`
- `Hosting/NewRelicHostApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs`
- `Hosting/NewRelicSummaryHostedService.cs`

## Source structure

- `Configuration`
- `Hosting`

## How it fits

This package stays outside `Cephalon.Engine` and `Cephalon.Observability` on purpose. The engine still owns diagnostics names and lifecycle signals, `Cephalon.Observability` still owns the shared telemetry contract, and this companion package layers New Relic-specific OTLP endpoint and `api-key` authentication guidance on top of the same OTLP baseline.

The New Relic slice is intentionally explicit about its two modes. If a host already has a shared OTLP collector or gateway path, the package keeps using the shared `Endpoint` or `UseSelfHostedDefaults` flow and only adds explicit resource context such as `service.namespace` and `deployment.environment.name`. If the host wants New Relic native OTLP ingestion instead, it can enable `Engine:Observability:Telemetry:NewRelic:UseNativeOtlpEndpoint`, keep the provider on `OpenTelemetry`, and configure either the raw OTLP `Headers` value or a structured `LicenseKey` that the package converts into the required `api-key` header. If `Endpoint` is omitted in that direct mode, the package derives the documented OTLP base endpoint from the configured `Region`.
