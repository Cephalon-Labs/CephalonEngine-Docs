## Overview

CephalonEngine is a configuration-driven, modular runtime platform. This document catalogs every registered blueprint, pattern, technology, transport, execution strategy, module, capability, data abstraction, diagnostics source, observability companion, and cloud exporter that ships with the engine.

## Blueprints

Blueprints define the top-level application shape. Each blueprint composes a fixed set of patterns.

### App blueprints (3)

- `modular-monolith` — Modular Monolith: a single host application with modular composition and module-first organization. Patterns: `modular-architecture`, `single-host-topology`, `module-first-organization`, `shared-foundation-pattern`.
- `modular-vertical-slice` — Modular Vertical Slice: a single host application with modules as boundaries and vertical slices inside each module. Patterns: `modular-architecture`, `single-host-topology`, `vertical-slice-organization`, `shared-foundation-pattern`.
- `microservice` — Microservice: an independently deployable service that still uses Cephalon modules and shared foundation. Patterns: `modular-architecture`, `microservice-topology`, `vertical-slice-organization`, `shared-foundation-pattern`.

### Suite blueprints (1)

- `microservice-suite` — Microservice Suite: a coordinated suite of Cephalon microservices composed from repeatable service slots based on the `microservice` app blueprint.

## Patterns

Patterns describe architectural decisions that can be composed into blueprints or selected individually through configuration.

### Pattern kinds (8)

- `durable-execution` — Durable Execution: replays state from `IEventStore`, validates sequential stream-version output from `IDurableExecution<TInput, TState, TOutput>`, appends continuation events, can surface pending timers/signals and operator-facing compensation actions through the shared durable runtime state, returns HTTP 200 with local output, HTTP 202 when continuation work or timer/signal coordination remains without local output, and HTTP 204 when the step completed without output.
