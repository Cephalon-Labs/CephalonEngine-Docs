This document describes the repo-native flow for producing the NuGet and template artifacts Cephalon intentionally ships.

## Scope

The release package-artifact baseline currently includes:

- shipped `src/Cephalon.*` packages
- `templates/Cephalon.TemplatePack`
- `samples/Cephalon.ReferenceModule.Operations`

The baseline intentionally excludes:

- benchmarks and playground hosts
- sample application hosts
- sample-only shared libraries such as the `MicroserviceSuite` governance and shared-foundation projects

`Cephalon.Cli` is now included as a dedicated `.NET tool` package, not as a generic library-style nupkg.

## Shared package metadata

Packable Cephalon packages now inherit shared NuGet metadata from `Directory.Build.props`:

- `Authors`
- `PackageLicenseExpression`
- `PackageProjectUrl`
- `RepositoryUrl`
- `RepositoryType`
- `PublishRepositoryUrl`
- a shared `PACKAGE.md` readme when a project does not provide a package-specific readme already

`Cephalon.TemplatePack` keeps its own package-specific `PACKAGE.md`.
`Cephalon.Cli` now also keeps its own package-specific `PACKAGE.md` so the tool install surface can document the stable `cephalon` command directly.

## Publish flow

Publish the intended release package set:

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/publish-package-artifacts.ps1
```

Skip the build when the repository has already been compiled:

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/publish-package-artifacts.ps1 -SkipBuild
```

Choose a custom output directory:

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/publish-package-artifacts.ps1 -OutputPath artifacts/packages-preview
```

Seed the local package feed emitted by a generated app:

```powershell
$generatedRoot = (Resolve-Path ./Acme.Store).Path
pwsh ./scripts/publish-package-artifacts.ps1 -OutputPath (Join-Path $generatedRoot '.cephalon/packages')
```

That path aligns with the `NuGet.config` emitted by `cephalon new` and the app-focused `dotnet new` starters, so `dotnet build` and `docker compose up --build` can restore Cephalon packages without editing the generated host first.

Install the packaged CLI tool from a locally published artifact:

```powershell
dotnet tool install --tool-path .\.tools\cephalon Cephalon.Cli `
  --add-source .\artifacts\packages-release `
  --ignore-failed-sources `
  --no-cache `
  --prerelease

.\.tools\cephalon\cephalon --help
```

## External module package staging

Published module `.nupkg` artifacts are distribution packages, not the final directory shape that `Engine:Discovery:PackageDirectories` loads directly.

Stage a published module package into a loadable package directory with the CLI:

```powershell
cephalon package stage `
  --package ./artifacts/packages-release/Cephalon.ReferenceModule.Operations.1.0.0.nupkg `
  --output ./plugins/reference-operations
```

If you are working inside this repository before installing the tool package, run the same flow with:

```powershell
dotnet run --project ./src/Cephalon.Cli -- package stage `
  --package ./artifacts/packages-release/Cephalon.ReferenceModule.Operations.1.0.0.nupkg `
  --output ./plugins/reference-operations
```

That command stages the selected `lib/<tfm>` surface plus `cephalon.package.json` into a directory the engine can load through `Engine:Discovery:PackageDirectories` or `Engine:Discovery:Packages:ManifestPath`.

For the full author -> publish -> trust -> load -> inspect walkthrough, see [External package lifecycle](external-package-lifecycle.md).

For the scenario-driven external replay of that same staged-package path, use `pwsh ./scripts/validate-out-of-tree-package-adoption.ps1`. It scaffolds a fresh app outside the repository, stages `Cephalon.ReferenceModule.Operations` through `cephalon package stage`, patches `Engine:Discovery:PackageDirectories` plus `Engine:PackagePolicy` and `Engine:Trust`, reruns `cephalon doctor --app-root`, and validates `/engine/packages`, `/engine/package-policy`, `/engine/trust-policy`, `/engine/snapshot`, and `/api/operations/status`.

For the matching higher-assurance detached-signature replay, use `pwsh ./scripts/validate-signed-package-governance.ps1`. It repacks `Cephalon.ReferenceModule.Operations` with a deterministic detached signature, stages the signed `.nupkg`, patches stricter `Engine:PackagePolicy` plus `Engine:Trust:TrustedSignaturePublicKeys`, validates the same runtime/package surfaces, and then proves a tampered signed package is denied when signature verification is required.

For the matching certificate-chain trust replay, use `pwsh ./scripts/validate-signed-package-certificate-chain-governance.ps1`. It keeps the same signed-package path, but patches `Engine:Trust:TrustedSignatureCertificates` plus `Engine:Trust:TrustedSignatureCertificateAuthorities` and proves the runtime/package surfaces expose `trusted-certificate-chain` verification plus the signing `certificateThumbprint`.

## Output

The publish script writes package artifacts to `artifacts/packages-release/` by default:

- `.nupkg` package files for the intended release-pack surface, including the `Cephalon.Cli` tool package
- `package-artifacts-manifest.json` with the packed project list, package kinds, package file sizes, SHA-256 checksums, and top-level source repository/revision provenance hints
- `package-artifacts.sha256` with one checksum line per produced package artifact for consumers that want file verification without parsing JSON

The JSON manifest now carries:

- `SourceRepository` and `SourceRevision` for the release source that produced the package set
- `PackageKind` per packed project such as `library`, `dotnet-tool`, `template-pack`, or `reference-module`
- `PackageFiles` entries with `Path`, `FileName`, `SizeBytes`, and `Sha256`

## Release validation

`pwsh ./scripts/validate-release.ps1` now includes package-artifact publishing by default alongside:

- solution build
- test execution
- framework-readiness audit output
- operational convention validation
- benchmark smoke coverage and guardrails
- reference-doc publishing

The GitHub Actions release-validation workflow now proves this package-publishing path on both Windows and Ubuntu through the same repo-native script entry point. The current Ubuntu leg uses `-SkipBenchmarks` while benchmark guardrails remain Windows-baselined.

The same workflow also carries a dedicated `.NET 11` readiness lane through `scripts/validate-dotnet-readiness.ps1`. That lane exists to assess future-SDK compatibility without changing the stable `net10.0` shipping floor. When package publication quality or support claims need to be assessed under a higher SDK explicitly, use the readiness script directly so the output report, `scripts/deployment-mode-support.json`, [deployment-mode support](deployment-mode-support.md), and the package-publishing docs stay truthful about what was actually validated.

## Maintenance rules

- keep the intended packable surface explicit; do not rely on solution-wide `dotnet pack` defaults
- keep benchmarks, playgrounds, and sample-only libraries out of the release package set unless they are deliberately promoted
- keep shared package metadata and any package-specific readmes aligned with the actual release surface
- keep the stable `cephalon` tool command name aligned across CLI packaging, docs, and validation coverage
- keep release checksum/provenance metadata aligned with the actual repository source revision and package file set
- keep the published-module staging flow aligned with the CLI package-stage command and external package lifecycle guide
- keep package-publishing docs, the publish script, and release-validation automation aligned when the package boundary changes
- do not let package support or deployment-mode claims exceed what `scripts/deployment-mode-support.json`, `validate-release.ps1`, and `validate-dotnet-readiness.ps1` actually prove together
