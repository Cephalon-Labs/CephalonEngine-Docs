This guide records the current Cephalon truth for future-framework assessment without silently changing the shipping baseline.

## Current repo truth

- stable Cephalon packages still ship on `net10.0`
- `global.json` still pins `.NET SDK 10.0.201`
- the template-pack package and source-generator surface remain the two `netstandard2.0` exceptions
- `.NET 11` is currently a readiness lane, not a default-target migration
- trim, Native AOT, and single-file support remain explicit `not-claimed` support statements tracked through [Deployment-mode support](deployment-mode-support.md) and `scripts/deployment-mode-support.json`, and external adopters can see the same contract through `cephalon doctor` plus `cephalon doctor --app-root <path>`

As of `May 2, 2026`, Microsoft has:

- shipped `.NET 11 Preview 1` on `February 10, 2026`
- shipped `.NET 11 Preview 2` on `March 10, 2026`
- shipped `.NET 11 Preview 3` on `April 14, 2026`
- published `11.0.100-preview.3` as the current SDK on the `.NET 11` download page
- not yet announced `Preview 4`; Microsoft's monthly preview cadence implies the next preview is most likely to land on or near the second Tuesday of `May 2026` (May 12, 2026), but Cephalon should keep that as an expectation, not a commitment, until the official `devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet` post and the `dotnet/core/release-notes/11.0/preview/` folder both publish that build
- kept `.NET 10` in active LTS support through `November 14, 2028`
- kept the official `.NET 11` final-release target on `November 2026`

When the next preview lands, refresh this anchor again rather than letting the dated section drift into multi-month staleness; the readiness lane is most useful when the dated truth is recent.

## Why Cephalon uses a readiness lane

Cephalon is a framework, so a framework-baseline change is not the same thing as “the latest SDK happens to compile the repo once.”

The readiness lane exists to keep these truths separate:

- shipping floor: the baseline Cephalon packages, templates, samples, and docs intentionally support today
- readiness surface: the newer SDK/runtime family that Cephalon is actively assessing for future adoption
- support claims: deployment-mode promises such as trimming, Native AOT, and single-file, which require explicit proof before they become repo truth

That split lets Cephalon learn early from preview analyzers and runtime changes without forcing adopters onto a preview-only baseline.

## Repo-native validation flow

Cephalon now ships `scripts/validate-dotnet-readiness.ps1`.

The script:

- records both the repo-selected SDK (`global.json`-aware) and the readiness SDK selected from a temporary working directory outside the repo root
- audits project target frameworks across `src/`, `tests/`, `samples/`, `templates/`, and `benchmarks/`
- confirms the shipped source baseline still stays on `net10.0`, with only the documented `netstandard2.0` exceptions
- confirms starter template project files still align with the stable `net10.0` floor
- fails if the repo starts using legacy `TargetFrameworkVersion`
- records the current trim / Native AOT / single-file claim status from the manifest-backed deployment-mode support contract
- can optionally build, test, publish reference docs, and publish package artifacts under the readiness SDK without editing `global.json`

Example audit-only run:

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/validate-dotnet-readiness.ps1 `
  -Configuration Release `
  -SkipBuild `
  -SkipTests `
  -SkipReferenceDocs `
  -SkipPackages
```

Example higher-SDK readiness run:

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/validate-dotnet-readiness.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

The script writes:

- `artifacts/dotnet-readiness-release/README.md`
- `artifacts/dotnet-readiness-release/dotnet-readiness-report.json`

## Release-validation contract

`pwsh ./scripts/validate-release.ps1` now emits the `.NET readiness` report as part of the normal release-validation flow.

That baseline report stays on the shipping toolchain and exists to keep framework, docs, package, and claim metadata honest.

GitHub Actions now adds a dedicated `.NET 11` readiness job that:

- installs the current `11.0.x` SDK channel
- runs the readiness script from a temporary working directory so the repo root `global.json` does not force SDK 10 selection
- uploads a dedicated `dotnet-readiness-sdk11` artifact

The result is deliberate:

- normal release validation keeps proving the stable shipping floor
- the dedicated readiness job proves the future SDK path without pretending the repo has already migrated

## Claim policy for trimming, Native AOT, and single-file

Cephalon does **not** currently treat trim, Native AOT, or single-file support as shipped repo truth.

For those claims to become real support statements, Cephalon must update all of the following together:

- `scripts/deployment-mode-support.json`
- [Deployment-mode support](deployment-mode-support.md)
- project properties that actually enable or declare the deployment mode
- `scripts/validate-dotnet-readiness.ps1`
- release-validation workflow coverage
- compatibility docs
- package-publishing docs
- project memory
- backlog and roadmap tracking

Analyzer-only settings are useful readiness signals, but they are not support claims by themselves.

The machine-readable contract exists so future support claims cannot drift away from what the readiness report and the human-facing docs say.

## What this slice intentionally does not do

- it does not move Cephalon's default target framework from `net10.0` to `net11.0`
- it does not retarget the template-pack starters
- it does not claim trim, Native AOT, or single-file compatibility yet
- it does not treat `.NET 11` preview builds as a production dependency baseline

## Next likely follow-through

After this readiness baseline, the next framework-focused work should be deliberate and explicit:

- analyzer drift review as new `.NET 11` previews and RCs arrive
- package-surface review for Microsoft and ecosystem package compatibility under `.NET 11`
- truthful deployment-mode validation before any trim / AOT / single-file claims are added on top of the shipped support-contract manifest
- the planned `scripts/validate-deployment-mode-claims.ps1` harness will be the machine-checkable proof gate for trim/AOT/single-file support claims; until it ships and reports `claim-truthful`, the support contract stays `not-claimed`. See [Deployment-mode support](deployment-mode-support.md) for the harness scope.
- an eventual baseline-migration lane once `.NET 11` is stable enough for Cephalon's package, tooling, and template defaults
