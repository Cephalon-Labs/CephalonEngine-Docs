title: Engine Surface Maturity Audit
editUrl: false
---

Surface maturity in this document reflects the repository state as of `April 30, 2026`.

## Why this document exists

Cephalon now ships a mix of:

- taxonomy and descriptor surfaces
- truthful runtime catalogs
- managed execution or provisioning runtimes
- adoption-ready tooling and operator experiences

That is healthy, but only if the repository says which kind of value each surface provides.

The current risk is not "metadata exists." The risk is letting descriptor-first work read like execution ownership when the package does not yet own the runtime path.

This audit is the repo-owned answer for that distinction.

## Surface maturity model

Every meaningful package or public/runtime surface should declare a current maturity target.

### `M0` Taxonomy

- defines vocabulary, descriptors, or selection semantics
- may shape scaffolding or planning language
- does not claim runtime ownership by itself

### `M1` Catalog + runtime truth

- publishes truthful descriptors, catalogs, runtime snapshots, or introspection
- may validate configuration or authored intent
- still does not claim managed execution or provisioning ownership

### `M2` Managed execution or provisioning

- owns one real execution, orchestration, or provisioning path
- publishes runtime state for that path
- documents boundaries, failure modes, and ownership clearly

### `M3` Operator automation

- supports real operator workflows, reconciliation, or automation loops
- exposes drill-down routes, lifecycle posture, and remediation-friendly runtime answers
- proves recovery, drift, or live-state handling beyond a happy path

### `M4` Adoption proof

- includes adoption-quality docs, samples/templates, and validation evidence
- is ready to be described as a shipped baseline for downstream teams
- keeps docs, runtime truth, tests, and packaging aligned

## Ownership modes

Maturity and ownership are related but different. Every surface should also describe who owns the real work:

- `taxonomy-only`: vocabulary or modeling only
- `application-managed`: consumer code or another runtime executes the work; Cephalon models or observes it
- `cephalon-managed`: Cephalon owns the execution or provisioning path
- `provider-managed`: a provider-specific Cephalon pack owns the execution or provisioning path

Intentional `taxonomy-only` and `application-managed` surfaces are valid. They just need to be labeled honestly.

## Current audit

| Surface | Primary role | Ownership mode | Current maturity | Next proof needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Cephalon.Engine` app model, manifest, runtime introspection, policy composition | Core runtime contract and composition | `cephalon-managed` | `M4` | Keep compatibility, docs, and generated surfaces aligned as new packs land |
| `Cephalon.Cli`, `Cephalon.Scaffolding`, `Cephalon.TemplatePack`, `Cephalon.ReferenceDocs` | Adoption and packaging surface | `cephalon-managed` | `M4` | Maintain package/version/template/reference-doc alignment |
| `Cephalon.Behaviors` core runtime and durable execution | Behavior execution substrate | `cephalon-managed` | `M4` | Continue adoption polish and guardrail coverage rather than adding parallel execution stories |
| `Cephalon.Behaviors.Http` module-owned behavior REST projection | REST profile metadata plus explicit module-owned public REST activation, Cephalon-managed materialization, governance, and runtime catalogs | mixed: `application-managed` profile/publication activation plus `cephalon-managed` materialization/runtime catalog truth | `M2` | Keep profile metadata explicitly non-publishing and continue adoption/operator automation proof without inventing ambient REST publication |
| `Cephalon.Data` shared CDC runtime plus provider-native pumps | Shared and provider-native data execution truth | `cephalon-managed` plus `provider-managed` | `M3` | More package-level external adoption proof and operator docs per provider family |
| `Cephalon.Edge.KubernetesGateway` and `Cephalon.Edge.Traefik` | Provider-specific control-plane automation | `provider-managed` | `M3` | More adoption-quality samples and package publishing guidance outside the repo |
| `Cephalon.Eventing` core package | Channel descriptors, staged publication, subscription runtime truth, public managed-execution binding catalog, abstraction-level subscription execution-readiness catalog, abstraction-level publication dispatcher, abstraction-level publication runtime-state catalog, abstraction-level dispatch-state/summary terminal-failure posture, `/engine/event-subscription-readiness`, `POST /engine/event-publications`, `/engine/event-publications/runtime*`, `/engine/event-dispatches/terminal-failures`, `snapshot.EventSubscriptionExecutionReadiness`, `snapshot.EventPublicationStates`, `snapshot.EventDispatchStates`, stable subscription runtime metadata vocabulary, opt-in direct in-process subscription execution, bounded process-local retry, and bounded process-local duplicate-completed execution suppression | mixed: `application-managed` descriptors/runtime reports plus `cephalon-managed` direct in-process execution, bounded process-local retry, bounded process-local idempotency, bounded publication action truth, publication runtime-state truth for direct execution or accepted outbox handoff, and typed dispatch terminal-failure operator truth over reported dispatch state | `M3` | Keep the in-process lane, retry loop, idempotency guard, operator publication route, publication runtime-state catalog, and dispatch terminal-failure posture bounded to reported state; only claim generic broker/inbox/durable retry/downstream delivery ownership when a package truly owns those paths |
| `Cephalon.Eventing.Wolverine` | Optional Wolverine-managed staged dispatch, bounded managed-dispatch retry with terminal dispatch-store semantics, publish-exception terminal proof, first-class terminal dispatch operator posture through the shared eventing state/summary surfaces, subscription execution, bounded managed-subscription retry, and terminal exhausted-attempt failure baseline | `provider-managed` | `M3` | Broaden inbound-consumption, broker-specific dead-letter, and operator-automation proof only when the runtime truly owns those paths |
| `Cephalon.Agentics` | Tool descriptors, managed tool dispatch, abstraction-level run-state catalog, bounded operator action route, bounded process-local executor retry posture, bounded process-local duplicate-completed suppression, approval-required and terminal-failure operator filters, `/engine/agent-tool-runs`, `/engine/agent-tool-runs/retry-pending`, `/engine/agent-tool-runs/idempotency-duplicates`, `/engine/agent-tool-runs/approval-required`, `/engine/agent-tool-runs/terminal-failures`, `POST /engine/agent-tools/{toolId}/runs`, `snapshot.AgentToolRuns`, and agent-workload runtime surface | mixed: `application-managed` descriptors plus `cephalon-managed` dispatcher/run-state/operator-action/bounded-process-local-retry/bounded-process-local-idempotency/read-filter baseline | `M3` | Broader agent operator workflows, durable approval workflows, durable retry queues, durable inboxes, memory persistence, dead-letter systems, cross-node exactly-once delivery, distributed scheduling, and provider-specific AI orchestration only after a package truly owns those paths |
| `Cephalon.Retrieval` | Knowledge collection descriptors plus managed lexical indexing, query execution, freshness state, abstraction-level index-state catalog, abstraction-level bounded query command seam, manual reindex command seam, opt-in background reindex scheduler, `/engine/knowledge-indexes`, `POST /engine/knowledge-indexes/{collectionId}/queries`, `POST /engine/knowledge-indexes/{collectionId}/reindex`, and `snapshot.KnowledgeIndexes` | mixed: `application-managed` source documents plus `cephalon-managed` index/query/operator-read/operator-query/manual-remediation/background-automation baseline | `M3` | Provider-specific vector/search engines, durable or distributed indexes, and distributed scheduler coordination only after a package truly owns those paths |
| `Cephalon.MultiTenancy` core package | Narrow tenant-resolution plus explicit governance-boundary runtime truth | mixed: `cephalon-managed` tenant-resolution core plus boundary entries for companion-owned or planned workflows | `M2` | Keep the base package focused on resolution while companion packages own concrete governance workflows |
| `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance` | Tenant membership, invitation, delivery dispatch/retry/status reconciliation, delivery-status observation storage, tenant-administration, domain-ownership verification/proof collection/polling, governance action workflows, optional ASP.NET Core governance endpoints with bounded delivery-status observation reads, filtered rollup summaries, attention-category drill-downs, provider-message drill-downs, remediation-action filters, and remediation hints, optional HTTP/SMTP/SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES/Microsoft Graph senders, optional Microsoft Graph Azure Identity token provider, optional ASP.NET Core SendGrid callback translation plus signed-webhook verification, process-local replay protection, and observation-store-backed event-id idempotency, optional ASP.NET Core Mailgun callback translation plus HMAC signed-webhook verification, bounded process-local replay-token protection, and observation-store-backed event-id idempotency, and optional ASP.NET Core Amazon SES over SNS callback translation plus SNS signature verification, bounded process-local SNS replay protection, observation-store-backed SNS message-id idempotency, verified SNS subscription confirmation, and verified SNS unsubscribe-confirmation observation | mixed: `cephalon-managed` governance core, ASP.NET Core adapter endpoints, filtered observation rollup summaries, attention-category drill-downs, provider-message drill-down filters, remediation-action filters, remediation hints over matched normalized observations, provider-neutral callback signatures, bounded process-local replay protection, local durable stores, HTTP/SMTP/SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES/Microsoft Graph sender companions, Microsoft Graph Azure Identity token-provider companion, SendGrid callback translation/signature verification/process-local replay/event-id-idempotency protection, Mailgun callback translation/signature verification/process-local replay-token/event-id-idempotency protection, and Amazon SES over SNS callback translation, opt-in SNS signature verification, bounded process-local SNS replay protection, observation-store-backed SNS message-id idempotency, opt-in verified SNS subscription confirmation, and opt-in verified SNS unsubscribe-confirmation observation; external provider delivery/status, distributed remediation execution, Microsoft Entra tenant governance, AWS account/identity governance, SNS topic/subscription creation, automatic resubscribe/restore, and subscription lifecycle governance remain `provider-managed` | `M2` | Actual DNS proof publication, provider-backed proof publication or mutation, remediation execution beyond state transitions, distributed or provider-backed membership/invitation/domain/action-store backends, additional provider-specific email API senders beyond the shipped SMTP/SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES/Microsoft Graph set, SMS/chat/CRM/identity-provider invitation senders, Microsoft Entra app registration/permission consent/mailbox access policy, AWS account/IAM/identity verification, DKIM/SPF/DMARC, SES sandbox/configuration-set event destination setup, SNS topic/subscription creation, automatic resubscribe/restore, subscription lifecycle governance, distributed retry queues, cross-node retry leases, provider-specific or distributed callback inboxes, cross-node callback replay protection, distributed event-id ledgers, provider-specific callback payload translation beyond shipped SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES translators, provider-specific callback signature verification beyond shipped SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SNS hardening, provider polling, identity-provider synchronization, public onboarding, and tenant-admin UI/backoffice flows only when the package truly owns those paths |
| `Cephalon.Audit` | Audit-recording host-agnostic baseline: `IAuditRecorder` service, `IAuditActorAccessor` ambient actor contract, default in-memory `IAuditWriter` baseline (configurable through `Engine:Audit:EnableInMemoryWriter`), `IAuditStoreCatalog` projection through `/engine/audit-stores` and `snapshot.AuditStores`, additive `IAuditHistoryReader` and `IAuditHistoryExporter` contracts, stable diagnostics conventions for audit-entry write success/failure | mixed: `cephalon-managed` in-memory writer baseline plus catalog projection plus ambient actor resolution; `application-managed` consumer-supplied actor accessors and durable storage opinion | `M1` | Durable provider-pack proof beyond `Cephalon.Audit.EntityFramework`, distributed audit ledgers, query-server adapters, and any cross-host actor governance only after a package owns those paths |
| `Cephalon.Audit.EntityFramework` | Durable Entity Framework audit history: `Engine:Audit:History` configuration plus `Engine:Databases` role contract, queryable `IAuditHistoryReader` implementation, bounded `IAuditHistoryExporter` NDJSON path, retention guidance through `Engine:Audit:History:Retention` | `provider-managed` | `M1` | Distributed audit-history backends, replication-aware reader/exporter coordination, and cross-host retention enforcement only after the runtime owns those paths |
| `Cephalon.Identity` | Host-agnostic identity and authorization baseline: metadata-driven `IAuthorizationEvaluator` default (configurable through `Engine:Identity:EnableDefaultEvaluator`), `IAuthorizationPolicyCatalog` projection through `/engine/authorization-policies` and `snapshot.AuthorizationPolicies`, `identity-authorization` technology runtime surface (configurable through `Engine:Identity:EnableRuntimeSurface`), dedicated diagnostics convention | mixed: `cephalon-managed` default metadata-driven evaluator, runtime surface, catalog projection, and diagnostics conventions; `application-managed` identity scheme, principal flow, and any product-specific policy engine | `M1` | Broader runtime authorization-decision proof, durable policy stores, distributed evaluation caches, and provider-specific identity-provider sync only after a package owns those paths |
| `Cephalon.Identity.AspNetCore` | ASP.NET Core integration baseline: minimal-API and controller-action policy mapping over the host-agnostic evaluator, optional projection of authenticated `ClaimsPrincipal` into the ambient `IAuditActorAccessor` contract when `Cephalon.Audit` is active | `application-managed` | `M1` | Deeper host/runtime truth such as endpoint-policy catalogs, scheme-aware diagnostics, and per-request decision projection only after the adapter package owns those paths; do not push ASP.NET Core concerns back into `Cephalon.Abstractions` |
| `Cephalon.Ids.Sfid` | Snowflake-style identifier generator: `Cephalon.Abstractions.Ids.IIdGenerator` over the official `Sfid.Net` generator, `SfidNet.Abstractions.ISfidGenerator` projection for companion packs, `AppProfile.Data.IdGenerator = sfid` runtime selection, optional generator topology through `Engine:Data:Ids:Sfid` | `cephalon-managed` | `M2` | Additional generator topologies (cluster-aware sequencing, time-shard rotation) and managed-clock observability only when the runtime owns those paths |
| `Cephalon.EventSourcing` and provider packs (`Cephalon.EventSourcing.EntityFramework`, `Cephalon.EventSourcing.MongoDB`, `Cephalon.EventSourcing.Redis`, `Cephalon.EventSourcing.Neo4j`, `Cephalon.EventSourcing.Cassandra`, `Cephalon.EventSourcing.ClickHouse`, `Cephalon.EventSourcing.Elasticsearch`, `Cephalon.EventSourcing.OpenSearch`, `Cephalon.EventSourcing.Qdrant`, `Cephalon.EventSourcing.Nats`) | Event-sourced aggregate contracts, descriptors, and provider-specific store catalogs without managed-execution proof in the engine | `application-managed` aggregate logic plus `provider-managed` per-pack store contracts | `M1` (family-level) | Managed event-store execution proof (append/read/projection lifecycle) per provider pack before promoting any individual pack from M1 catalog-only to M2 managed-execution; the catalog-only stance is intentional until those proofs ship |
| `Cephalon.Observability` core plus exporter and dependency-health companion family | Shared observability options, startup summary projection, telemetry-export configuration intent, optional OpenTelemetry/Serilog/Kubernetes/AWS/GCP/Azure Monitor/Alibaba Cloud/Huawei Cloud/Oracle Cloud/DigitalOcean/OpenShift/Tanzu/Grafana Cloud/New Relic configuration packs, optional dependency-health probe core plus per-provider probe packs (Cassandra, ClickHouse, Consul, Elasticsearch, Http, Kafka, Memcached, MongoDB, MQTT, MySQL, NATS, Neo4j, OpenSearch, Oracle, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, SqlServer) | `cephalon-managed` for the observability core, configuration packs, and dependency-health probe baselines; `taxonomy-only` for per-provider dependency-health probe packs that ship descriptors without a probe runtime of their own | `Cephalon.Observability` core at `M2`; cloud configuration packs and `Cephalon.Observability.DependencyHealth.Core` at `M1`; per-provider dependency-health probe packs at `M0` | Genuine telemetry collection happens in the host runtime's OpenTelemetry stack; only promote a configuration pack above M1 when it owns runtime collection or a managed exporter loop, and only promote a dependency-health probe pack above M0 when it owns a probe runtime, not just a descriptor |
| Multi-tenancy invitation delivery sender family (`Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.HttpDelivery`, `.SmtpDelivery`, `.SendGridDelivery`, `.MailgunDelivery`, `.AmazonSesDelivery`, `.MicrosoftGraphDelivery` plus `.SendGridDelivery.AspNetCore`, `.MailgunDelivery.AspNetCore`, `.AmazonSesDelivery.AspNetCore`, `.MicrosoftGraphDelivery.AzureIdentity`) | Provider-neutral host-agnostic invitation-sender contract plus shipped HTTP webhook / SMTP relay / SaaS API / Microsoft Graph senders, optional ASP.NET Core callback translation, signed-webhook verification, bounded process-local replay protection, observation-store-backed event-id idempotency, and the Azure Identity token-provider companion that serves the Microsoft Graph sender | `cephalon-managed` shared dispatch contract, callback translation, signed-webhook verification, replay protection, idempotency stores; the senders' upstream provider services remain `provider-managed` outside the engine | `M2` family-wide; promote a single sender above the family floor only when that sender owns adoption-quality proof beyond the shared dispatch + callback contract that justifies independent maturity language | All six senders share the M2 label by design: each owns the same managed dispatch, the same callback handling shape (where applicable), and the same replay/idempotency hygiene over a different upstream API. Per-sender promotion requires (a) provider-specific adoption proof unique to one sender (deeper reconciler, distributed retry queue, identity-provider sync, etc.), and (b) matching matrix row + component doc + planning record updates in one slice. Until then, treat the family floor as M2 and the per-sender component docs as the per-sender adoption truth |

## Immediate planning consequences

- stop expanding descriptor-first surfaces inside mixed-maturity families unless the work is explicitly labeled `M0` or `M1`
- do not describe `M0` or `M1` packages as if they already own execution, orchestration, or provisioning
- treat the `Cephalon.Eventing` in-process direct subscription lane plus bounded process-local retry, bounded process-local idempotency, `POST /engine/event-publications`, `/engine/event-publications/runtime*`, and first-class terminal dispatch-state operator posture, the optional `Cephalon.Eventing.Wolverine` provider-managed dispatch/subscription lane plus bounded terminal dispatch and subscription retry proof, the `Cephalon.Agentics` dispatcher/run-state lane plus direct operator read/action seams, bounded process-local executor retry posture, bounded process-local duplicate-completed suppression, approval-required filter, and terminal-failure filter, and the `Cephalon.Retrieval` lexical index/query/freshness lane plus direct operator read, bounded query action, manual reindex, and opt-in background reindex seams as current managed vertical proofs instead of widening descriptor breadth before ownership is real
- keep `Cephalon.MultiTenancy` intentionally thin in the base package; the governance family now owns the concrete governance workflows plus optional ASP.NET Core routes, HTTP/SMTP/SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES/Microsoft Graph sender companions, Microsoft Graph Azure Identity token-provider companion, provider-neutral callback signatures/replay protection, filtered observation rollup summaries, attention-category drill-downs, provider-message drill-down filters, remediation-action filters, remediation hints over matched normalized observations, optional SendGrid callback translation plus signed-webhook verification, bounded process-local signed-callback replay protection, observation-store-backed SendGrid event-id idempotency, optional Mailgun callback translation plus HMAC signed-webhook verification, bounded process-local replay-token protection, observation-store-backed Mailgun event-id idempotency, optional Amazon SES over SNS callback translation, opt-in SNS signature verification, bounded process-local SNS replay protection, observation-store-backed Amazon SNS message-id idempotency, opt-in verified SNS subscription confirmation, and opt-in verified SNS unsubscribe-confirmation observation. Actual DNS proof publication, provider-backed proof publication or mutation, remediation execution beyond state transitions, distributed or provider-backed membership/invitation/domain/action stores, additional provider-specific email API senders beyond the shipped SMTP/SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES/Microsoft Graph set, SMS/chat/CRM/identity-provider senders, Microsoft Entra app registration/permission consent/mailbox access policy, AWS account/IAM/identity verification, DKIM/SPF/DMARC, SES sandbox/configuration-set event destination setup, SNS topic/subscription creation, automatic resubscribe/restore, subscription lifecycle governance, distributed retry queues, cross-node retry leases, provider-specific or distributed callback inboxes, cross-node callback replay protection, distributed event-id ledgers, provider-specific callback payload translation beyond shipped SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES translators, provider-specific callback signature verification beyond shipped SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SNS hardening, provider polling, identity-provider synchronization, public onboarding, and tenant-admin UI/backoffice flows remain explicitly outside the current claim
- treat the ASP.NET Core invitation delivery dispatch endpoint as a bounded `M2` action seam over the host-agnostic dispatcher, and treat the delivery-status observation read endpoint plus filtered rollup summaries, attention-category drill-downs, provider-message drill-down filters, remediation-action filters, and remediation hints as a bounded `M2` operator/audit projection over normalized store records; do not promote either endpoint into provider-specific sender ownership, distributed retry queues, callback-inbox, provider-polling, distributed remediation execution, distributed-replay, or exactly-once language until a package owns those paths
- use `Cephalon.Behaviors`, `Cephalon.Behaviors.Http`, `Cephalon.Data`, and the shipped edge provider packs as the current examples of truthful runtime ownership

- actual DNS proof publication, provider-backed proof publication or mutation, remediation execution beyond state transitions, distributed or provider-backed membership/invitation/domain/action-store backends, additional provider-specific email API senders beyond the shipped SMTP/SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES/Microsoft Graph set, SMS/chat/CRM/identity-provider invitation senders, Microsoft Entra app registration/permission consent/mailbox access policy, AWS account/IAM/identity verification, DKIM/SPF/DMARC, SES sandbox/configuration-set event destination setup, SNS topic/subscription creation, automatic resubscribe/restore, subscription lifecycle governance, distributed retry queues, cross-node retry leases, provider-specific or distributed callback inboxes, cross-node callback replay protection, provider-specific callback payload translation beyond shipped SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES translators, provider-specific callback signature verification beyond shipped SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SNS hardening, provider polling, identity-provider synchronization, public onboarding, and tenant-admin UI/backoffice flows when `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance` or provider packs truly own those paths

## Promotion checklist

Before a surface claims the next maturity level, confirm the proof is real:

1. `M0 -> M1`: truthful runtime or catalog answer exists and docs say what is not owned yet.
2. `M1 -> M2`: one managed path exists end to end, including runtime state, failure posture, and ownership language.
3. `M2 -> M3`: operators can observe, reconcile, or remediate the path without relying on hidden knowledge.
4. `M3 -> M4`: samples, package docs, validation, compatibility/readiness guidance, and planning truth all match the shipped behavior.

## Definition of done for future planning

When a new runtime or package surface lands, the same slice should update:

- source
- component docs
- this audit when maturity or ownership changes
- roadmap and backlog entries
- compatibility or readiness docs if the public/package contract changes
- samples, tests, and benchmarks when the claimed maturity requires them

The goal is not to force every surface to become `M4`.

The goal is to make each surface honest, intentional, and easy to adopt.
