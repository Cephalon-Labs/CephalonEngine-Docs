title: Cephalon Technology Packs
editUrl: false
---

Technology packs are the runtime companion pattern for future-facing workloads in Cephalon.

They sit between pure metadata and full application blueprints:

- `Blueprints` define project shape
- `Patterns` define supporting design behavior
- `Technologies` define workload posture
- `Technology packs` provide reusable runtime primitives for those technologies

## Maturity, ownership, and long-range alignment

Each shipped technology pack carries explicit maturity (`M0` through `M4`) and an ownership mode (`taxonomy-only` / `application-managed` / `cephalon-managed` / `provider-managed`). Read those labels before assuming a pack is runtime-ready:

- per-package truth: [`engine-surface-maturity-audit.md`](engine-surface-maturity-audit.md)
- consolidated cross-reference covering technology packs and every other shipped family: [`conformance-matrix.md`](conformance-matrix.md)
- per-pack runtime surfaces (`/engine/*` routes, `snapshot.*` keys, catalog interfaces): [`runtime-contract-index.md`](runtime-contract-index.md)

Technology pack selection is also a long-range planning decision; not every workload that sounds plausible today belongs in the engine. Use [`long-range-direction.md`](long-range-direction.md) to check that a candidate pack's substrate, provider boundary, and lifetime expectation match the engine's multi-horizon stance before introducing a new pack family. Packs that feel right for one transient era should ship as additive companion packs, not as engine-core sprawl.

Authoring guardrails for a new technology pack are unchanged below; the table here is the *adopter-facing* maturity reminder so consumers do not assume `M0` taxonomy-only packs already own runtime execution.


## Why this exists

Technology profiles should not stop at documentation or scaffold hints. When a workload becomes important enough to need reusable services, capabilities, or conventions, it should move into a companion package instead of forcing changes into the engine core.

That keeps the engine extensible without making every new trend a built-in subsystem.
Some profiles can also start as engine-owned contract baselines before a dedicated companion pack
exists. The new `cell-based-architecture` profile now follows that path: the engine ships
`CellBoundaryDescriptor`, `CellRouteDescriptor`, `CellHealthIsolationDescriptor`,
`CellTrafficAutomationRuntimeDescriptor`, `/engine/cells`, `/engine/cell-routes`,
`/engine/cell-health-isolations`, `/engine/cell-traffic-automations`, and the
`cell-boundaries`, `cell-routes`, `cell-health-isolations`, plus `cell-traffic-automations`
technology runtime surfaces today. That engine-owned baseline now also carries additive
`providerId` plus `edgeNodeIds` targeting on the shared automation catalog. The shared
materialization seam is now also explicit through `CellTrafficAutomationMaterializationResult`,
`CellTrafficAutomationMaterializationStates`, `ICellTrafficAutomationProviderMaterializer`, and
`ICellTrafficAutomationEdgeMaterializer`; `Cephalon.Edge` now ships the first concrete
edge-runtime materializer while the provider-named result/state types stay available as
compatibility helpers over the same contract. Future service-mesh, gateway, or provider companion
packs can reconcile provider-owned or edge-owned traffic posture back onto the same shared
automation catalog instead of publishing a second materialization registry. The first concrete
provider-specific control-plane follow-through is now also shipped through
`Cephalon.Edge.KubernetesGateway`, which projects Kubernetes Gateway API `Gateway` plus `HTTPRoute`
intent back onto the same shared automation catalog and publishes that view through the
`kubernetes-gateway-traffic-materializations` technology surface. That same pack now also supports
opt-in live `observe-only` Gateway API polling plus `apply-and-reconcile` ownership-aware
`HTTPRoute` writes so projected intent, write posture, and observed control-plane status can stay
on one runtime truth instead of spawning a second provider-local view.

## Shipped baseline packs

Current baseline packages:

- `Cephalon.Agentics`
  - runtime services and capability activation for `AgenticWorkloads`
  - registers `IAgentToolCatalog` when the profile is selected
  - registers the Cephalon-managed abstraction-level `IAgentToolDispatcher`, abstraction-level `IAgentToolRunCatalog`, and `IAgentToolRunReporter` when execution is enabled
  - lets ASP.NET Core hosts trigger one bounded managed run through `POST /engine/agent-tools/{toolId}/runs` without taking a dependency on implementation types
  - can retry failed executor attempts inside the same process when `ExecutionMaxAttempts` is greater than `1`, reporting `retry-scheduled` run-state posture instead of claiming durable retry ownership
  - can suppress duplicate completed `toolId + runId` executions inside the same process when `EnableExecutionIdempotency` is enabled, reporting `skipped` duplicate-completed posture instead of claiming durable inbox or cross-node exactly-once ownership
  - lets operators filter approval-blocked and terminal-failed runs through `/engine/agent-tool-runs/approval-required` and `/engine/agent-tool-runs/terminal-failures`
  - lets modules add `IAgentToolExecutor`, `IAgentToolExecutionPolicy`, and `IAgentToolExecutionObserver` services without making the host own the tool loop
- `Cephalon.Eventing`
  - runtime services and capability activation for `EventDrivenIntegration`
  - registers `IEventChannelCatalog`, `IEventSubscriptionCatalog`, `IEventSubscriptionExecutionBindingCatalog`, the abstraction-level `IEventSubscriptionExecutionReadinessCatalog`, the abstraction-level `IEventPublicationRuntimeCatalog`, the abstraction-level event-dispatch runtime descriptor/state catalogs, and stable event subscription plus dispatch runtime metadata keys when the profile and options enable those paths
  - lets `Cephalon.Engine`, host adapters, and operator tooling read subscription execution readiness through `/engine/event-subscription-readiness` and `snapshot.EventSubscriptionExecutionReadiness` without taking a direct dependency on the eventing pack
  - registers the abstraction-level `IEventPublicationDispatcher` when a real publishing path exists, allowing host adapters to expose bounded publication actions such as `POST /engine/event-publications` without depending on eventing implementation types
  - lets `Cephalon.Engine`, host adapters, and operator tooling read publication runtime state through `/engine/event-publications/runtime*` and `snapshot.EventPublicationStates`, with in-process outcomes separated from outbox `accepted` handoff truth
  - can opt into a Cephalon-managed direct in-process subscription execution lane through `EnableInProcessSubscriptionExecution`, registered `IEventSubscriptionExecutor` services, and `IEventPublisher`, including bounded process-local retries through `InProcessSubscriptionMaxAttempts` / `InProcessSubscriptionRetryDelayMilliseconds` and duplicate-completed execution suppression through `EnableInProcessSubscriptionIdempotency` / `InProcessSubscriptionIdempotencyRetentionMinutes` when explicitly configured, without claiming durable broker, durable inbox, cross-node exactly-once, durable retry-queue, or distributed retry ownership
- `Cephalon.Eventing.Wolverine`
  - optional companion adapter proof for managed dispatch over `EventDrivenIntegration`
  - projects runtime truth for the current Wolverine-backed outbox, dispatch loop, bounded provider-managed dispatch retry with terminal storage semantics, first-class terminal dispatch-state/summary posture, managed subscription bindings, bounded provider-managed subscription retry, terminal exhausted-attempt failure posture, and subscription readiness without turning Wolverine into an engine-core dependency
- `Cephalon.Retrieval`
  - runtime services and capability activation for `KnowledgeRetrieval`
  - registers `IKnowledgeCatalog`, the abstraction-level `IKnowledgeIndexCatalog`, `IKnowledgeIndexer`, and `IKnowledgeQueryEngine` when the profile and options enable those paths
  - lets modules add `IKnowledgeDocumentProvider` services so Cephalon can build a managed lexical index, bounded query path, operator reindex path, and opt-in background reindex scheduler without making hosts own the retrieval loop
- `Cephalon.MultiTenancy`
  - runtime services and capability activation for `MultiTenancy`
  - registers `ITenantResolver` and `ITenantContextAccessor` when the profile is selected

  - registers `ITenantInvitationCatalog` and `ITenantInvitationValidator` when invitation validation is enabled
  - registers `ITenantInvitationDeliveryRunCatalog` and `ITenantInvitationDeliveryDispatcher` when invitation delivery dispatch is enabled; external delivery requires a registered `ITenantInvitationDeliverySender`

  - registers `ITenantInvitationDeliveryStatusReconciler` when invitation delivery status reconciliation is enabled; provider-specific callback translation, provider-specific signature verification, and provider polling stay outside the core pack and belong in host adapters or provider companions such as the SendGrid, Mailgun, and Amazon SES ASP.NET Core translators

  - maps `MapCephalonTenantInvitationDeliveryStatusCallbacks()` so normalized invitation delivery-status observations can be reconciled through a fail-closed ASP.NET Core endpoint
  - maps `MapCephalonTenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservations()` so normalized observation history can be read, filtered by attention, provider message id, or remediation action, and summarized through a bounded fail-closed ASP.NET Core endpoint
  - can verify provider-neutral HMAC-SHA256 callback signatures over the exact normalized JSON body when `TenantInvitationDeliveryStatusCallbackSigningSecret` is configured
  - can reject duplicate signed normalized callbacks inside a bounded process-local replay window without claiming durable inboxes or cross-node exactly-once delivery
  - keeps endpoint enablement, route pattern, cache-control, authorization, provider-message-match enforcement, callback signature headers/key id/tolerance, signed-callback replay retention/cache limits, observation read default/max limits, and endpoint-description posture configurable through `Engine:MultiTenancy:Governance:AspNetCore`

These packages are also used as scaffold hints for the matching built-in technology profiles.
The phase-8 data packs are companion packages rather than technology packs, but they can now enrich `EventDrivenIntegration` truth by projecting staged outbox producers and application-managed inbox stores into the eventing runtime surfaces when both baselines are active.

## Runtime pattern

The expected layering is:

1. select technology profiles through `Engine:Technologies`
2. install companion packages that understand those profiles
3. register the companion package in startup
4. let module/package runtime behavior activate only when the technology is actually selected
5. let installed modules contribute pack-specific descriptors through the pack's contributor services instead of pushing every descriptor into host startup

The shared cell traffic-materialization seam now also carries one stable lifecycle vocabulary that
provider and edge packs can reuse instead of inventing provider-local status taxonomies:
`CellTrafficAutomationOwnershipStates`, `CellTrafficAutomationDependencyStates`,
`CellTrafficAutomationDriftStates`, and `CellTrafficAutomationLifecycleActions`. The shared runtime
catalog projects those values back onto `providerMaterialization.*`, `edgeMaterialization.*`, and
derived `materialization.*` metadata so requested, observed, conflicted, drifted, or dependency-missing
posture stays comparable across `Cephalon.Edge`, `Cephalon.Edge.KubernetesGateway`, and
`Cephalon.Edge.Traefik`.

## Authoring pattern

A technology pack should usually contain:

- `Configuration/`
  - options or defaults for the workload
- `Services/`
  - runtime contracts the app can consume
- `Modules/`
  - one or more modules that bridge the pack into Cephalon
- `Registration/`
  - `EngineBuilder` extensions for easy startup registration

Recommended contracts to use:

- `ITechnologyContributor`
  - when the pack adds new technology descriptors to the runtime catalog
- `ITechnologyServiceContributor`
  - when services should only activate for selected technologies
- `ITechnologyCapabilityContributor`
  - when capabilities should only activate for selected technologies

- `Cephalon.Edge`
  - `IEdgeNodeContributor` and `IEdgeNodeRegistry`

Those contributor interfaces are the preferred way for installed modules to add descriptors into a selected technology pack. Project-level code can still replace the final catalog service through DI when it needs full control.

For `Cephalon.Agentics`, `AgentToolDescriptor` can now also link back to:

- published capability keys through `capabilityKeys`
- one execution graph through `executionGraphId`
- one hosted execution through `hostedExecutionId`

That keeps AI-facing tool metadata anchored in the same module, capability, execution-graph, hosted-execution, and runtime-story contracts the engine already exposes.

When execution is enabled, `Cephalon.Agentics` also owns one narrow tool-dispatch loop. The dispatcher is still host-agnostic: modules contribute descriptors through `IAgentToolContributor`, register exactly one `IAgentToolExecutor` for each executable tool id, and optionally add policy or observer services. Runtime surfaces then report whether each tool is `cephalon-managed`, `awaiting-executor`, or `not-configured`, plus retry policy, idempotency policy, latest run outcome, retry-scheduled counts, retry-pending posture, approval-required posture, duplicate-completed posture, terminal-failure posture, and totals. When `ExecutionMaxAttempts` is greater than `1`, failed executor attempts are retried inside the same process and reported as `retry-scheduled`; the default remains a single attempt. When `EnableExecutionIdempotency` is enabled, duplicate completed `toolId + runId` executions observed inside the configured process-local retention window are reported as `skipped` with `idempotencyPolicy = completed-run`, `idempotencyDurability = none`, and `idempotencyScope = process-local`; the default preserves repeated execution behavior. The direct run-state read seam and the bounded dispatch action contract now live in `Cephalon.Abstractions.Agentics`, so ASP.NET Core hosts and tooling can read `/engine/agent-tool-runs`, `/engine/agent-tool-runs/retry-pending`, `/engine/agent-tool-runs/idempotency-duplicates`, `/engine/agent-tool-runs/approval-required`, `/engine/agent-tool-runs/terminal-failures`, `/engine/agent-tool-runs/{runId}`, `/engine/agent-tool-runs/by-tool/{toolId}`, trigger `POST /engine/agent-tools/{toolId}/runs`, and read `snapshot.AgentToolRuns` without depending on `Cephalon.Agentics` implementation types. That is the boundary of the current managed proof; broader autonomous planning, memory stores, durable approval workflows, durable retry queues, durable inboxes, dead-letter systems, cross-node exactly-once delivery, distributed schedulers, or provider-specific AI orchestration remain future companion work unless another package explicitly owns them.

When ingestion and querying are enabled, `Cephalon.Retrieval` now owns one narrow lexical retrieval loop. Modules still own the source material through `IKnowledgeDocumentProvider`, while the pack owns indexing, bounded query execution, index state, freshness reporting, manual operator reindexing, and an opt-in in-process background reindex scheduler for registered collections. Runtime surfaces report `indexingOwnership`, `queryOwnership`, `backgroundReindexingOwnership`, `backgroundReindexingScheduled`, provider readiness, latest index outcome, document count, query count, freshness state, scheduler scope/timing metadata, and a query fingerprint rather than raw query text. ASP.NET Core hosts can request the same bounded query and indexer paths through `POST /engine/knowledge-indexes/{collectionId}/queries` and `POST /engine/knowledge-indexes/{collectionId}/reindex` without referencing retrieval implementation types. That is the boundary of the current managed proof; vector databases, embeddings, distributed indexes, durable search clusters, rerankers, provider-specific semantic search, distributed scheduler coordination, and leader-election semantics remain future companion work unless another package explicitly owns them.

When multi-tenancy is selected, `Cephalon.MultiTenancy` owns one narrow tenant-resolution loop. The base package resolves configured tenant ids, tenant keys, host names, defaults, and single-tenant fallback through `ITenantResolver`, then exposes the ambient answer through `ITenantContextAccessor` and the `tenant-resolution` surface.

`Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance` owns the concrete companion proofs beside that base package: membership cataloging/evaluation, invitation cataloging/validation, invitation delivery dispatch/run-state, retry queue execution/coordination/scheduling, delivery-status reconciliation and observation storage, tenant-administration workflow commands, declared domain-ownership validation/workflow/challenge/publication-plan/proof collection/verification/polling, and approval/remediation action decision/workflow state. Its membership, invitation, invitation-delivery retry, delivery-status observation, domain-ownership, and action stores are in-memory by default and become Cephalon-managed local JSON durable stores when their file paths are configured.

ASP.NET Core hosts can install `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.AspNetCore` for fail-closed HTTP proof serving, tenant-administration commands, invitation-delivery dispatch actions, normalized delivery-status callbacks, provider-neutral Cephalon HMAC callback signatures, bounded process-local signed-callback replay protection, and bounded observation reads with filtered rollup summaries plus attention-category drill-downs, provider-message drill-downs, and remediation-action filters. Hosts that want first-party outbound senders can add `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.HttpDelivery`, `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.SmtpDelivery`, `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.SendGridDelivery`, `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.MailgunDelivery`, `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.AmazonSesDelivery`, or `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.MicrosoftGraphDelivery` without changing the core dispatcher. Hosts using Microsoft Graph can add `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.MicrosoftGraphDelivery.AzureIdentity` for first-party `DefaultAzureCredential`/managed-identity token acquisition without moving Microsoft Entra-specific code into the governance core.

Provider callback translation stays additive: `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.SendGridDelivery.AspNetCore` translates SendGrid Event Webhook arrays, can verify SendGrid signatures, can reject bounded process-local signed-callback replays, and can skip duplicate `sg_event_id` observations; `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.MailgunDelivery.AspNetCore` translates Mailgun webhook objects, can verify Mailgun HMAC-SHA256 signed webhook envelopes including `parent-signature` for subaccount events, can reject duplicate verified Mailgun tokens inside a bounded process-local replay window, and can skip duplicate `event-data.id` observations; and `Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.AmazonSesDelivery.AspNetCore` translates SNS `Notification` envelopes that carry Amazon SES event publishing payloads, can verify SNS signatures before translation, can confirm verified SNS `SubscriptionConfirmation` envelopes when explicitly enabled, and can observe verified SNS `UnsubscribeConfirmation` envelopes without invoking `SubscribeURL` when explicitly enabled. The shared ASP.NET Core observation read surface can also summarize and filter by provider message id and remediation action, then return deterministic remediation hints for matched attention categories, but those hints are operator guidance over stored normalized observations only. Actual DNS proof publication, provider-backed proof publication or mutation, remediation execution beyond state transitions, distributed or provider-backed governance storage, additional provider-specific email API senders beyond the shipped SMTP/SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES/Microsoft Graph set, SMS/chat/CRM/identity-provider invitation senders, distributed retry queues, cross-node delivery leases, exactly-once delivery, provider-specific or distributed callback inboxes, cross-node callback replay protection, distributed event-id ledgers, automatic resubscribe/restore, subscription lifecycle governance, provider-specific callback payload translation beyond the shipped SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SES translators, provider-specific callback signature verification beyond shipped SendGrid/Mailgun/Amazon SNS hardening, provider polling, identity-provider synchronization, public onboarding, and tenant-admin UI/backoffice flows remain outside the current managed proof until the governance package or provider packs own those paths explicitly.

`Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.SendGridDelivery.AspNetCore` also owns bounded process-local replay rejection for verified SendGrid signed Event Webhook callbacks and observation-store-backed event-id idempotency for translated SendGrid events. The replay guard reports replay policy/key/scope/durability/retention/cache posture through `tenant-invitation-delivery-sendgrid-status-callbacks`, but it remains non-durable and per process. The event-id guard is enabled only when the governance observation store is enabled, checks the normalized `sendgrid:{sg_event_id}` observation id in `ITenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservationStore`, and inherits that store's durability. Neither guard is a distributed replay ledger, durable callback inbox, distributed event-id ledger, or cross-node exactly-once promise.

`Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.MailgunDelivery.AspNetCore` owns Mailgun webhook payload translation plus optional HMAC-SHA256 signed-webhook verification, bounded process-local replay-token rejection, and observation-store-backed Mailgun event-id idempotency. It reports route, authorization, body/event limits, provider-message matching, translation ownership, signature verification posture, replay policy/key/scope/durability/retention/cache posture, event-id idempotency policy/key/scope/store durability posture, and inbox/polling boundaries through `tenant-invitation-delivery-mailgun-status-callbacks`. Durable callback inboxes, distributed replay/event-id ledgers, provider polling, and cross-node exactly-once delivery remain outside this proof.

`Cephalon.MultiTenancy.Governance.AmazonSesDelivery.AspNetCore` owns Amazon SES over SNS payload translation, opt-in SNS signature verification, bounded process-local SNS replay protection, observation-store-backed Amazon SNS `MessageId` idempotency, opt-in verified SNS subscription confirmation, and opt-in verified SNS unsubscribe-confirmation observation. It reports route, authorization, body/event limits, provider-message matching, translation ownership, SNS signature verification posture, SNS signature-version/topic/certificate policy, process-local SNS replay posture, SNS message-id idempotency policy/key/scope/store durability posture, SNS subscription-confirmation posture, SNS unsubscribe-confirmation observation posture, and inbox/polling boundaries through `tenant-invitation-delivery-amazon-ses-status-callbacks`. The message-id guard is enabled only when the governance observation store is enabled, checks the normalized `amazon-ses-sns:{MessageId}` observation id in `ITenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservationStore`, skips duplicate translated events before reconciliation, and inherits that store's durability. Subscription confirmation is enabled only when a host opts in with SNS signature verification; it confirms verified `SubscriptionConfirmation` envelopes through replaceable `IAmazonSesSnsSubscriptionConfirmationClient`. Unsubscribe-confirmation observation is enabled only when a host opts in with SNS signature verification; it validates but never invokes `SubscribeURL` because visiting that URL can restore the subscription. SNS topic/subscription creation, automatic resubscribe/restore, subscription lifecycle governance, durable callback inboxes, distributed replay/event-id ledgers, provider polling, and cross-node exactly-once delivery remain outside this proof.

ASP.NET Core hosts can also map `MapCephalonTenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservations()` to expose bounded/filterable `GET /engine/tenant-invitations/delivery-status/observations` reads over `ITenantInvitationDeliveryStatusObservationStore`; that route returns filtered status/attention/remediation/outcome/source/providerMessageId/channel/sender/tenant summaries derived from matched observations before the record limit is applied and accepts `attention=` drill-down filters for delivery failures, deferred/suppressed/unknown statuses, reconciliation gaps, and recording gaps plus `providerMessageId=` filters for provider callback tracebacks and `remediation=` filters for stable operator next-action labels. It is an operator/audit read surface over normalized observations, not a provider-specific callback inbox, provider poller, distributed remediation executor, or distributed replay ledger. The dispatch endpoint records safe adapter metadata before invoking the core dispatcher, but it still depends on registered sender extensions for actual provider delivery and does not create distributed retry queues, cross-node leases, exactly-once delivery, or provider-specific notification semantics.

Runtime introspection contract:

- `ITechnologyRuntimeContributor`
  - used by packs to project their active runtime surface into a transport-neutral snapshot
- `ITechnologyRuntimeCatalog`
  - host-agnostic abstraction for reading the merged runtime surface set in code
- `IRuntimeIntrospectionSnapshotProvider`
  - engine-level abstraction for reading one operator-facing snapshot that combines the runtime manifest, runtime status, and active technology-pack surfaces
- `GET /engine/technology-surfaces`
- returns the active pack surfaces and the merged entries visible to the runtime after host options, module contributors, and in-process runtime transitions have been applied; agentic tools now also surface linked capability keys, live execution-graph and hosted-execution state, managed execution readiness, and latest run-state truth when those links or reports exist, while the same reported runs are also available through `snapshot.AgentToolRuns`; retrieval collections now also surface provider readiness, indexing/query/background-reindexing ownership, per-collection scheduler inclusion, freshness state, document counts, query counts, latest run outcomes, scheduler scope/timing metadata, and query fingerprints when indexed, scheduled, or queried; multi-tenancy now surfaces the active tenant-resolution answer, governance companion boundaries, and the concrete `tenant-memberships`, `tenant-invitations`, `tenant-administration`, `tenant-domain-ownership`, plus `tenant-governance-actions` companion proofs, including membership-store, invitation-store, invitation delivery dispatch/sender/run-state posture, delivery status reconciliation/latest status posture, delivery-status observation store posture/count/latest observation, tenant-administration command ownership, domain-ownership-store, proof-challenge issuance, proof-publication planning, proof-evaluation, HTTP proof collection, configured DNS TXT proof collection, proof-verification runner, proof-polling runner, opt-in background proof-polling run state, and action-store durability metadata, when the governance pack is installed; ASP.NET Core governance adapters also surface `tenant-administration-http-endpoints` route, mapping, and authorization posture, `tenant-invitation-delivery-http-endpoints` dispatch route/auth/contract posture, plus `tenant-invitation-delivery-status-http-endpoints` signed-callback signature/replay posture and bounded observation-read route/auth/limit/summary-dimension/attention/provider-message-filter/remediation-filter/remediation-hint posture when registered; SendGrid ASP.NET Core adapters surface `tenant-invitation-delivery-sendgrid-status-callbacks` route/auth/translation/signature/replay/event-id-idempotency posture when registered; Mailgun ASP.NET Core adapters surface `tenant-invitation-delivery-mailgun-status-callbacks` route/auth/translation/signature-verification/replay-boundary posture when registered; Amazon SES ASP.NET Core adapters surface `tenant-invitation-delivery-amazon-ses-status-callbacks` route/auth/translation/SNS-signature/replay/message-id-idempotency posture when registered
- `GET /engine/snapshot`
  - returns the broader runtime introspection snapshot when operators need manifest, runtime status, and technology-pack surfaces in one payload

## Guardrails

- keep packs additive; do not mutate engine core behavior globally
- prefer activating services/capabilities from `TechnologySelection` instead of branching in hosts
- prefer pack-specific contributor services over hardcoded host-owned descriptor lists when extending a shipped pack
- prefer `ITechnologyRuntimeContributor` when a pack needs an operator-facing runtime snapshot instead of inventing host-specific ad-hoc endpoints
- keep built-in technology profiles lightweight; move reusable runtime behavior into packs
- only create a new blueprint when project shape changes materially
- only add a new built-in technology profile when validation, guidance, or scaffold/package hints are distinct enough to justify it
