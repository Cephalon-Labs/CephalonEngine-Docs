`Cephalon.Observability.CassandraDependencies` adds a supported Cassandra dependency-health path for Cephalon hosts.

## What it owns

- `Engine:Observability:DependencyHealth:Cassandra` configuration binding
- contact-point based Cassandra probe settings with optional keyspace and credentials
- lightweight CQL health-query execution through `CassandraCSharpDriver`
- reusable `IDependencyHealthContributor` integration for Cassandra-backed readiness and diagnostics

## Main surfaces

- `Configuration/CassandraDependencyDefinition.cs`
- `Configuration/CassandraDependencyHealthOptions.cs`
- `Hosting/CassandraDependencyHealthServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`
- `Services/CassandraDependencyHealthProbeHostedService.cs`

## Source structure

- `Configuration`
- `Hosting`
- `Services`

## How it fits

This package keeps Cassandra-native contact-point, keyspace, and query handling out of `Cephalon.Engine` while still feeding the existing dependency-health contract. Hosts can opt into it when they need Cassandra readiness to surface through `/engine/dependencies`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, and `/engine/diagnostics` without rewriting cluster-session probes per host. When active, it also publishes its probe event ids through the shared runtime diagnostics catalog.
