title: Cephalon Learning Roadmap
editUrl: false
---

This guide turns the current Cephalon repository into a structured 30-60-90 day learning path.

It is intended for contributors who want to learn:

- `.NET 10` in a real product-style repository
- framework and engine architecture
- runtime, build-time, and documentation surfaces
- relational and non-relational data provider patterns
- cloud, container, and operator-facing deployment concerns

This roadmap assumes a start date of `April 13, 2026` and runs through `July 11, 2026`.

Starter artifacts that pair with this roadmap live under [Learning starters](learning/index.md).
The current repo-grounded architecture baselines that should be read beside this roadmap live in [Architecture review (April 2026)](architecture-review-2026-04.md) and [Architecture review (May 2026)](architecture-review-2026-05.md). The long-range planning frame and consolidated quality baseline live in [Long-range engine direction](long-range-direction.md) and [Engineering standards](engineering-standards.md); contributors should skim both before committing to the 30-60-90 day plan so the work plan stays aligned with the engine's long-term posture and quality gates. The consolidated per-package adoption truth lives in [Conformance matrix](conformance-matrix.md), and the consolidated map of `/engine/*` routes, `snapshot.*` keys, and runtime catalog interfaces lives in [Runtime contract index](runtime-contract-index.md); use both as quick reference while learning specific surfaces during the plan.

## Why this guide exists

Cephalon is not a tutorial repository and it is not a single application shell.

It is a modular runtime platform with a broad surface area:

- host-agnostic contracts
- runtime composition
- app-model and transport descriptors
- data and eventing companion packs
- observability and cloud-oriented host integration packs
- scaffolding, CLI, template-pack, and reference-doc tooling

Without a learning order, it is easy to read the codebase sideways and miss the design center.

This guide keeps the sequence deliberate:

1. `.NET 10`
2. architecture and framework design
3. database topology and provider families
4. cloud, container, operations, and build-time adoption

## Working agreements from project memory

This roadmap follows the standing agreements in [Project memory](project-memory.md).

Use these rules throughout the full 90-day path:

- treat hand-authored docs under `docs/` as the primary human-facing product documentation
- treat runtime introspection routes such as `/engine/manifest`, `/engine/snapshot`, and `/engine/runtime-story` as part of the product, not as optional debug extras
- keep repository-facing written artifacts in English
- prefer explicit registration and deterministic runtime composition over ambient magic
- keep host adapters thin and push reusable behavior into engine services, modules, or companion packs
- when behavior changes, inspect the related docs graph and update every impacted hand-authored document that references that surface
- when version-sensitive `.NET`, library, or provider guidance matters, verify it from primary or official sources instead of relying on stale memory alone
- remember that Cephalon is still in an active POC and invention phase, so a cleaner long-term engine contract is allowed to replace a weaker compatibility shim deliberately

## Outcomes by day

### By day 30

You should be able to:

- explain the Cephalon layering model
- run the showcase sample in at least two modes
- describe the difference between blueprints, patterns, transports, and technology profiles
- navigate the main runtime introspection routes
- make a small code, test, and doc change in the repo safely

### By day 60

You should be able to:

- explain the engine-owned database-topology contract
- trace write/read/history/outbox role selection through configuration, runtime, and sample behavior
- explain the current read-model sync and durable projection-job flow
- compare Cephalon's relational and non-relational provider families at a high level

### By day 90

You should be able to:

- describe Cephalon as a modular runtime platform instead of as a collection of packages
- reason about runtime, build-time, and operator-facing surfaces together
- explain the current cloud, container, observability, and tooling story
- write a credible architecture recommendation or RFC grounded in the repo

## Architecture lens to carry through the roadmap

### Current strengths

- layering is clear and consistent with the repo mission
- runtime introspection is a real product surface rather than an afterthought
- docs, tests, samples, and runtime routes increasingly reinforce the same truths
- companion packs keep the engine core from absorbing every technology concern directly

### Current risks

- the package and provider surface is expanding faster than a unified conformance story
- newer contributors can confuse `shipped`, `baseline`, and `planned` language across docs
- some operator-friendly truths are still sample-level patterns before they become engine-level primitives
- maintenance overhead will continue to grow across analyzers, docs, tests, providers, and deployment guidance

### Current gaps

- `Engine:Databases` is strongest on the Entity Framework path and is not yet equally unified across all provider families
- migration orchestration is still more startup-apply and command-template oriented than deploy-orchestration oriented
- serverless is visible as a technology profile and planning concept but is not yet a first-class host path comparable to ASP.NET Core or Worker
- a broad provider and observability conformance matrix is still needed

### Current architecture recommendations

- add maturity labeling in docs so readers can distinguish proven surfaces from baseline or planned slices quickly
- build conformance suites for data, event-sourcing, and observability companion packs
- promote proven sample-level operator answers into optional engine-level runtime catalogs when the contract is ready
- keep protecting the core design rule: host-agnostic contracts, explicit runtime truth, and thin host adapters

## Evidence checkpoints

By the end of the roadmap, make sure you can point to evidence in all of these places:

- docs
- runtime introspection routes
- tests
- sample behavior
- source contracts in `Cephalon.Abstractions`
- engine behavior in `Cephalon.Engine`
- host wiring in `Cephalon.AspNetCore` or `Cephalon.Worker`

If one claim about Cephalon cannot be traced to at least one of those, treat that claim as provisional until you verify it.
